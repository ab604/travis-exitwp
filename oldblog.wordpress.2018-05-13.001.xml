		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/dlight5"><img title="Dlight5" height="132" alt="Dlight5" src="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/images/dlight5" width="100" border="0" style="float:left;margin:0 5px 5px 0;" /></a>I don't know if this happens to other people, but every so often I undergo this delusion where I forget that life isn't fair and I start to think 'It'll all be alright...' in some mad attack of optimism. Of course, there is no rational reason to believe everything will be alright and it is very disappointing when life turns out not to be fair or alright just from hoping it will be so. That leaves life turning on the factors of chance and personal effort and imagination.</p>
<p>Actually (and I apologise for being so morbid),but it'd be fair to say it's not going to be alright as we're all going to die one way or the other and the longer one does survive the more grieving one has to do. Which reminds me of a bad joke - An old married couple in their nineties contact a divorce lawyer, who pleads with them to stay together after 75 years of marriage, &quot;Why now? Why not last it out?&quot; <br />The little old lady pipes up, &quot;We wanted to wait until our children were dead.&quot;</p>
<p>It's the end of term and I hate my course and I've been living the last nine weeks on a 'it'll be alright..' basis. Like the couple in the joke, I'm never quite sure how long one is supposed to keep going and at what point it's reasonable to make a change. I don't think I'm at that point yet.</p>
<p>My time has been spent learning and relearning a lot of Maths and Physics which is good when it is well taught, but often it is not. The best teacher is our fluid dynamics lecturer. It's a difficult subject as so little of it is intuitive, but he's really good at connecting all the pieces of the puzzle together from definitions through first principles and onto complexity.<br />I've been learning about materials and their properties, such as concrete and steel which also has the potential to be interesting but often there is little depth beyond how these materials can be best used to ensure making a profit. <br />And I've been learning a bit more computer programming and using drawing software. </p>
<p>Of the five Ws - What?Where?When?Who?Why? - the last one rarely gets a look in, though as you can probably guess it's the one I find most interesting. To me it's the one that gives sense to the others.<br />Civil Engineering covers a large range of things from understanding transport networks down to specifying the nuts and bolts for a bus shelter, so we've been introduced to a little of a lot of things. It has the potential to be really interesting and world changing, but at the moment it is not. Last year my lecturers conveyed a love of their subject's that enthused us (well, me anyway). This lot act like they can't really be bothered most of the time. And when they can, it's all about getting a job at the end, which while important, seems like missing the point of learning. <br />So maybe I'll end up quitting and returning to part time study and full time work or change courses or Universities. There is rarely only one way to go about things. </p>
<p>In the meantime, I've been taking comfort in reading a bit of philosophy (Descartes and English Mathematician G.H. Hardy) and having not been to a gallery in the best part of a year, I've been twice in the past month. It's interesting to spend time considering things which are essentially qualitative as opposed to the largely quantitative realms of science and engineering. Maybe it's just a reflection of my frame of mind at the moment, but I came away from looking at Art with the feeling that over the last couple of hundred years a quite pessimistic view of humanity has evolved through Art which is in contrast to the general optimism of the Science Project. That said, a lot of what I looked at was excellent and the Art did make me realise that I want to be doing something that is creative and that it is the lack of use of my imagination that I'm finding so frustrating on my course. And last year showed me that science can be very very creative and imaginative, so it's really annoying when it's not this year. I'm hoping this will change. </p>
<p>I've never been much of a diary keeper and I started this blog it was with the proviso that I'd only write when I had something at least mildly interesting to say (if only to myself!) or experiences to share. I haven't really got anything interesting to say at present and haven't done very much except study, work or swim since September, hence the dull postings (and it's taken two weeks to write this.)<br />
<p>The picture above was my attempt to capture the light at this time of year and there are a couple of additions to my Photo Scrapbook on the right.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/fire4_1.jpg"><img width="100" height="56" border="0" alt="Fire4_1" title="Fire4_1" src="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/images/fire4_1.jpg" style="margin:0 5px 5px 0;float:left;" /></a>This is what it looks like after the 25 million pound research centre next door to my block of flats burnt down.<br />Only a couple of days before, I had been contemplating the fact I have no back up for my files outside of my flat and how to remedy that.Then on Sunday 30th October, Steve called me to ask if I was OK as he saw my University was on fire. Fortunately for me I was in Devon at the time. For those less lucky it was a story of lost PhD research and a night in other accommodation as they were all evacuated from our building. Most importantly though no-one was hurt. It's still under investigation, but the whole thing started at about 6.30 am when it's suspected that some gas canisters exploded and two buildings went up in flames.</p>
<p>So top of my priority list now is to get some off-site back up sorted!</p>
<p>Sadly, my course is quite rubbish and I'm rather hating being there. After last years brilliant lecturers, who were well organised, enthusiastic and could explain difficult concepts in a way that made them understandable, this course is poorly taught. Most of them seem incapable of giving a coherent structured lecture and rely far too heavily on PowerPoint - which should be banned in my opinion, except for the extreme examples where something cannot be explained verbally and/or with chalk. It's ironic considering they are supposed to be Engineers, which in my experience is all about communication.<br />To back up this point, a quick aside: I've been attending a swim club since the summer and I went for a drink with some of the others after training a couple of weeks ago for the first time. After I had been ranting about my hatred of the misuse of PowerPoint, one of my fellow swimmers revealed that he is a senior lecturer over at Biomedical Sciences and relied on PowerPoint a lot for his lectures.<br />Then last week, on my way into training, he stopped me and told me that he'd decided to not use PowerPoint for his most recent lecture and he observed that far less people left during the break than usual. I rest my case.</p>
<p>The only lecturer who seems to know what he is doing, is, unsurprisingly from another department - the Maths Professor, who rips through material at near light speed dispensing gems such as:<em> &quot;Being a Mathematician, I prefer not to call a spade a spade when a gardening implement will do...&quot;</em> and when doing a difficult bit of intergration, <em>&quot;This is point where we say: 'Give up!' Go home and decide to study History instead.&quot; </em>before promptly showing us how to solve it.&nbsp; I love the Maths guys! If I was up to it, I'd go and join them or the Physicists.</p>
<p>Most of the learning I <em>have</em> been doing is out of a book, by myself. Learning about the materials that make structures and a little computer programming and software use. Nothing interesting enough to mention, not even as trivia.</p>
<p>Addressing the request for light heartedness - how about the three young Goth lads in Cassocks last Tuesday? They were walking through the rain on campus, hair matted to their faces, mascara running down their cheeks. It warmed my heart to see such dedication. <br />Bet they stank of wee once they got inside and started heating up though...</p>
<p>Another request I received was for a picture of my new (used) bike. I'm not mad on it's looks myself, but it is a hell of a lot more comfortable on the motorway. 1000CCs of 'feelings of inadequacy' curing machinery...<a></a></p>
<p><a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/sv1000s_front_1.JPG"><img width="54" height="72" border="0" src="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/images/sv1000s_front_1.JPG" title="Sv1000s_front_1" alt="Sv1000s_front_1" style="margin:0 5px 5px 0;float:left;" /></a> <a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/sv1000s_side.JPG"><img width="100" height="75" border="0" src="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/images/sv1000s_side.JPG" title="Sv1000s_side" alt="Sv1000s_side" style="margin:0 5px 5px 0;float:left;" /></a>
</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>So the plan at present is to stay here until at least the end of the academic year and review my options then. I'm hoping things improve, but if they don't I'll have to consider making a Plan B.</p>
<p>Other than being fed up, swimming, running and reading, in my life as a recluse, I've been watching some decent TV for a change:<br /> <br />The final series of Six Feet Under was pretty cool stuff about death. Really! <br />Bodies on BBC2, watching through my fingers. Gross, funny and disturbing NHS drama. <br />Curb Your Enthusiasm and The Thick of It on More4 and BBC3, some of the most offensively funny TV in a long time. <br />And on DVD cos the schedulers are too stupid to put it on a regular channel - The Wire, a superb crime series so far, probably the best I've seen. I'm only up to Episode 4.</p>
<p>All TV that has made me laugh and cry and reminded me that it can be a great medium. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2005/10/3585c-crane2.jpg"><img width="80" height="58" border="0" alt="Crane2" title="Crane2" src="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/images/crane2.JPG" style="margin:0 5px 5px 0;float:left;" /></a>In a recent conversation it was suggested that I should write about more light hearted things. The problem with this is that I don't feel very light hearted much of the time. <br />To be brutally honest, I've been striving since I was a child just to reach the point where I wake up feeling like I'm actually glad to have woken up at all. Maybe other people spring out of bed singing 'Zip-a-dee-doo-da' and have love in their heart for every person they meet, but I don't. <br />Certainly I joke and laugh when I am with others, partly because I see it all as absurd anyway and partly<em> because</em> life is hard.<br />So this being my space, I kind of feel it's my prerogative to say what I feel and how I see it regardless of what anyone else says about me thinking too much or being too whatever. My standard response is: 'No, you don't think enough' - so there! (Just kidding.)<br />I've been surrounded by 19 year olds away from home for the first time this past week and their constant twittering is making serious inroads into my tolerance and empathy levels. I didn't like 19 year olds much when I was 19 and I like them less now. (Boys outside in the pub below my window singing Rugby songs tonight.) And then I got handed a timetable at induction with a 'Team Building Day' on it&nbsp; and my heart sank to a new low. So much for science! I'm fully expecting David Brent to be running it. Or at least the Assistant to the Manager.</p>
<p>And while I'm having a good moan, I got a form for a scholarship with questions on it such as, 'What is your greatest personal achievement?' I am very tempted to submit, 'Not being born into poverty or war.' just to see if I get a response. Or 'Taking part in a Roasting with Stan Collymore'. What is the point of these questions?! Do they really provide any useful insight?</p>
<p>You may be able to detect a negative tone to this posting and, yes, I'm feeling pretty fed up as I commence Year Two at University. Whatever happens in the next few months, I'll stick it out until the end of the academic year, but there isn't much point continuing something that I'm not enjoying unless I have no choice. Such is the benefits of being a decadent Westerner. Usually in life I've found there to be periods like this and then periods when things are less rubbish. Fortunately, one gets old and dies regardless of how well or badly its going.</p>
<p>I'll strive for light hearted next time. Maybe. Right now - Grrr. Humans and being a Human. </p>

Are some more human than others?&quot; Stephen Lewis UN Envoy for Africa</em></p>
<p>This first quote comes from a documentary called &quot;Shake hands with the Devil&quot; about the Rwanda genocide that happened 10 years ago this year. I watched it a couple of months back and with things I've been reading since and things that have happened it the outside world, these words have come back to me again and again. The original context was questioning why do we help some people in trouble but not others, but I've come to realise them as much more fundamental questions.</p>
<p><em>&quot;The reason the Iraq torture pictures were shocking was not the events they portrayed...The only shocking thing was the act of photography itself, the realisation that people wanted to record these events, that they believed there were other people who would want to see them too. Is that really such a long way from the killer who keeps pictures of his victims?&quot; Michael Marshall</em></p>
<p>This quote is just from a crime novel about a serial killer. Linking it to first quote, it reminded about how humans and our behaviours appear to exist along a spectrum and that our positions on it are not fixed. It is all too easy to find ourselves crossing the lines into areas that dehumanise ourselves and others.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks back I nearly got into a fight. Two young men throwing apples at me as I walked down the street. It sounds absurd and it was. The good old fight or flight mechanism kicked in, and said &quot;Fight&quot;.<br />So having exchanged a few insults, I say to one of them, who has now approached me close enough to talk, &quot;Would you like me to throw something at you?&quot; &quot;Go on then.&quot; was the response, a standard reply for this situation, a proper male stand off like you see in all the nature documentaries.<br />I was on my way to the bottle bank and had in my hand a bag of empty bottles. This guy had no visible form of defence to hand and for a couple of seconds I seriously thought about trying to smash him over the head with a bottle. I was so angry. Then I caught myself and engaged my brain and rattled through a few strategic thoughts i.e. it doesn't end here, even if I win now there is revenge and the law to consider. After those I came to thoughts similar to the quotes above. What do I become if I allow these feelings to rule my actions? However much I hate this guy right now, he is for better or worse a human being. I couldn't think of anything to say, so I just looked at him until he got bored of the stand off and left with a few parting remarks about me being queer. (It amazes me that people still consider that an insult! To me it sounds like trying to insult someone over hair colour or their height.)<br />I went on my way feeling pretty angry, fuming really, as my body had followed it's biological history and got me all prepared for a fight that never happened, but I was at least physically intact.</p>
<p><em>&quot;They don't win matches, we drop the ball. Wrong. Sometimes the bad guys win because they're as good as we are. Strength of will and purity of hate will make up a huge technology gap.&quot; Michael Marshall</em></p>
<p>This last quote is also from the same book as the second and made me think about the 'haves' mindset when it comes to 'have nots'.</p>
<p>Over the last ten months there has been a lot of visible suffering on the screens.The Asian Tsunami, Iraq, Darfor, London bombings, Hurricane Katrina. It becomes easy to respond by thinking of these things as elsewhere and the bad luck of others, but in my mind we are all connected. Not in some linear narrative way, more like a network of connections like the world wide web. Even my own little local difficulty reminded me of this and that sticking my head in the sand is not an option for the long term. Everyone is connected and all these foolish divisions of nationalities and race and gender do us no favours in solving the real problems that face us all or in overcoming hate and our temptations towards the dehumanising end of the belief spectrum. Looking out for strangers is looking out for ourselves. And not only is that a moral position, it is a strategic one. It's harder to hate someone who is treating you well, so it's harder to justify doing something bad to them or see them as an object.</p>
<p>Humans and especially men are built for violence. It is part of our evolutionary heritage and has a role to play in sexual selection too. So while we are trapped in these shells it can't be eradicated, but we've also evolved brains that allow us to reflect and adapt. I'm trying. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my last post I wrote of observation led thinking and then went on to write about relativity. This might seem contrary and it does seem to be a source of endless trouble these days with the whole subjective and objective truth arguements. To me it's a fallicious interpretation to see them in opposition. My feeling and it is only that, is that subjective reality emerges from the objective rules. (See my previous musings about initial conditons for the type of process I mean.) <br />Thoughts can be objective even if actual observation cannot be absolutely so. If one draws up a set of rules to describe something that are consistent, such as those for chess or numbers between one and ten, this can be said to be truly objective even if they only exist in an abstract sense. Such notions can then be used to make guesses and predictions about the subjective world of actual experience. A sufficient (and what is sufficient is going to depend on context) correlation between the objective model and reality is what matters when determining the usefulness of a model.<br />It was the observations of successive generations of humans combined with those exploring purely abstract notions that has led to the current understanding and landmarks such as the Uncertainty Principle. Humans being humans though, struggle with this, we (well, me for one) aren't masters of subtlety, we like it simple, all objective or all subjective.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/barcode2.jpeg"><img width="100" height="185" border="0" alt="Barcode2" title="Barcode2" src="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/images/barcode2.jpeg" style="margin:0 5px 5px 0;float:left;" /></a>When I finally got around to re-reading my last post,I wasn't entirely sure it made sense. Today I came across a paragraph in a Maths book that rather neatly sums up what I was trying to get at:</p>
<p><em>&quot;To renounce the goal of comprehending the 'thing in itself', of knowing the 'ultimate truth', of unravelling the innermost essence of the world, may be a psychological hardship for naive enthusiasts, but in fact it was one of the most fruitful turns in modern thinking.&quot;</em></p>
<p>That was written by Richard Courant in 1941. My even simpler interpretation of it is to say that it is more useful to dwell on questions that can be answered and things that can be controlled, than on those which cannot. Of course determining what those things are is a problem in itself and is often far from obvious, but it is a reasonable principle nonetheless.</p>
<p>The turn of modern thinking that started this way of thinking and the minimisation of metaphysics, can probably be attributed to Galileo back in 1591. He was the first person to really pursue the idea of observations as a guide to understanding rather than just pure thought that the philosophers prefer. <br />Once you start down the road of observation led thinking, all sorts of things get ruled out, most famously in the twentieth century the idea of truly objective observation: the observer effects the object and that the observers position is relative, so the observations of one observer may differ from another observer of the same object. (It's now 100 years since Einstein first published his theories.)<br />These concepts have had all sorts of knock on effects into other areas of thinking and how we live. Ideas about Art and Society all got shaken up too. Out go ideas of a clock work universe and leaders with answers to all our problems and in come ideas of complexity and individuality and personal responsibility. Though most people seem to conveniently ignore that our actions always do have consequences.</p>
<p>I've been watching Art School on BBC2 this week (Evil TV I know!) and I've found it fascinating watching John Humphrey's. Like me, he's guilty of wanting nice simple answers and explanations for everything and is unable to just do it and accept all the happy mistakes and unexplainable aspects of why he likes or doesn't like something. He just seems constantly frustrated and it reminds me of my own experiences with Art. At the same time it looks so much like fun, proper self indulgence, and in the light of the quote above, as a naive enthusiast, it's got me thinking about doing something creative again myself. Maybe some painting or drawing. (I did make a fractal for this post if that counts!)</p>
<p>On the University front, I passed my resit and therefore the Foundation Year. In two weeks I begin the first year of my degree and I'll find out what Civil Engineering is really all about. For anyone that is interested you can download this excellent little leaflet: <a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/files/civil_engineering.pdf">Civil Engineering PDF</a>
I've sent it to a few people before.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I'll put together some more music and get back to reading more books and watching some more films.<br /> </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&quot;If you thought...science was certain - well, that is just an error on your part&quot; Richard Feynman</em></p>
<p>This quote reminded me of something I've been frequently accused of - having an answer for everything.<br />The latest occurance of this accusation came at a time when I was considering that the quality of the answers one gets is directly related to the quality of the questions one asks. Or as it is more usually said, &quot;Ask a silly question....&quot;<br />Producing answers is a simple matter of logic but it doesn't </p>
<p>This quote appears in a lecture given in the 60s to explain what Physics is about and how it works as a method of investigation. The point (I feel) he was trying to make was that sticking one's neck out is what it is all about, but that this is done only from what is already providing a solid base from which to work.<br />For example, when I am studying and doing my exercises and my answers don't match with the answers provided: Is it more likely that I have made an error or that the theory I was working from is wrong? Logic suggests it is me at error, though there is the further possibilty of a typo in the answer sheet.<br /> </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/tree_sunset_3.JPG"><img width="100" height="46" border="0" src="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/images/tree_sunset_3.JPG" title="Tree_sunset_3" alt="Tree_sunset_3" style="margin:0 5px 5px 0;float:left;" /></a>A week before my resit and my self discipline is waning, so once again I have to remind myself what I'm doing here:</p>
<p>A large part of my adult life so far has been spent either participating in or bearing witness to the worst of human behaviour - violence, prejudice, narcissism, indifference. Engineering and Science are not magical solutions, but they point in the right direction, away from them. I'm well aware of the road to hell being paved with such good intentions: BSE or Thalidomide being prime examples. But I need a daily reminder that humans can aspire to and achieve better than I often experience first or second hand.</p>
<p>When I was a child I used to love and believe in the idea of magic. My
favourite tape for long journeys in the car was of Greek Myths. <br />As I
was reaching adulthood I thought that the magic could be found in Films
and Art, and that guided my previous attempt at Further Education by going to Art College. What
I found, as I began to look closer and closer at these things, was that
they actually became less and less profound and magical. On top of which it felt more and more that the people employed to teach me were trying to convince me of how great the Emperors New Clothes were and I actually started to feel quite cheated and angry about it all. It all seemed bogus and empty.<br />Conversely, the more closely I have began to study science the more profound the answers become. It starts to reveal hidden connections and patterns that describe the shape of the world. It shocks me almost every time I learn something new or see some new connection that I'd never noticed before.<br />Funnily enough, it's also given me some context in which to start appreciating the Arts again. Now I don't look too closely and attempt to fruitlessly analyse something subjective. These things (books, paintings, films etc.) appear to me as pieces of mirror. Each piece reflecting both something of the creator and something of me when I look into it. The trick for me being, not to look too hard and long, lest I do become lost like narcissus. As a result, some of their magic has returned.</p>
<p>I've always found a tension between my hatred of false divisions and the human need to categorise things to make sense of them. Which is another surprising aspect of the science project, the home of reductionism, is how it also seeks to unite disparate aspects of reality. Art in the context of reality as a whole becomes more understandable, than seen as a separate reality. (Maybe I'm pointing out the bleedin' obvious again, but I'm a slow thinker and often get the wrong end of the stick.)</p>
<p>The first words I heard on the Radio when I woke up today was, <em>&quot;...we're preparing to go to Mars when 80% of humanity is still in the mud and the blood.&quot;</em> They've stayed with me. And while I doubt I can produce some marvel of personal expression that an Artist might, I probably can go some way towards solving a science/engineering problem that'll be a tiny step out of the mud and blood.</p>
<p>I don't know if I like the idea of magic cos I'm lazy and that it offers a short cut to solutions or solutions to impossible problems. Maybe it's also the warmth it provides against the coldness of reality, but I'm pretty sure the only magic I'm likely to find is in a book, on a screen, in a gallery or on a CD. But that's no bad thing.</p>
<p>I realise I've never actually said what the magic is, but it'll be different for everyone, so you'll have to fill in the meaning yourselves.</p>
<p>Now it's time to study again.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/man_1.jpg"><img width="74" height="167" border="0" src="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/images/man_1.jpg" title="Man_1" alt="Man_1" style="margin:0 5px 5px 0;float:left;" /></a>One of the good things about summer is the chance to bunker down with lots of books. The selection I am currently reading has given me plenty to think about, both in terms of what I do and how the world is.<br />One of the simplest questions in life is, &quot;What is it for?&quot; or even &quot;Why is it that way?&quot; <br />Why buy those clothes, choose that record, study that subject, take that job etc. ? What is the point?</p>
<p>I've come to realise that the answer to this is not something static and imovable, it's a qualitative answer. That is to say it changes and is not an absolute for all times, places and people. </p>
<p>In itself this may not be an amazing insight, but what has surprised me is that it is an understanding I've come to through reading about and studying Maths, the subject probably most associated in most peoples minds with absolutes and quantification. In his excellent book Ian Stewart describes how from mathematical (and therefore also physical) laws arise dynamic processes and that the dynamic processes also give rise to laws and therefore the futility of adopting a position of either reality is all objective or all subjective. <br />What this led me to think was, why do people adopt such positions? What are <em>they </em>for?&nbsp; It seems that to me humans are often concerned with being right, when the question and answer may well be absurd to begin with. <br />Another description Ian Stewart wrote is that an Artist seeks to express their experiences of the world, while an Engineer seeks to change it, an Entrepreneur seeks to exploit it, a Scientist seeks to understand how it really works and finally a Mathematican seeks generalities that cut across the obvious subdivisions. While I have become drawn into Engineering, I feel that each of these things exist inside me to some extent and probably inside everyone else too. </p>
<p>One correspondent told me how she feels at peace after physical training.<br /> </p>

<p>Here's the moral right at the start: <em>"Chance favours the prepared mind." </em>Pat Cadigan</p>
<p>When I woke up at 7 am on the day of my holiday, it occurred to me that I ought to get some insurance, so I tapped away at my keyboard for a few minutes at got a policy shortly before leaving the house to catch my bus. It was a fresh sunny day in Southampton and the bus turned up promptly and took me to the railway station. This was when my troubles began.</p>
<p>Looking up at the board, I could see my train to the airport had been cancelled, so I went over to ask what was going on. Two people had thrown themselves onto the track at Chichester and all trains on the route were suspended. I began to wonder if this might mean me missing my plane to Sardinia.
The helpful staff printed me off a new route that needed three trains, but would get me there on time and I rushed to jump on the first train.</p>
<p>Three trains and a lot of humping my bags about later, I arrived at Gatwick with about half an hour before check in closed. The queues were enormous and after about 25 minutes the man pulled me out of the queue and checked me in as the very last passenger for my flight. I ran to the gate and jumped on the bus meeting P, J and T.</p>
<p>And we waited. And then we waited some more. After about 10 minutes we then drove to the plane, going all over the place before getting aboard. And we waited some more. Sitting on the runway for about an hour. There had been a spillage on the main runway and they need to bring some more luggage to the plane, so everything was delayed. The cabin crew decided to play a quiz to entertain us and myself and the five year old girl next to me along with her Mother teamed up to win second prize! A big bag of Maltesers, which cheered us up immensely.</p>
<p>Two hours flying later, at passport control, I commented to P &amp; J, that I thought we'd had all our bad luck last year during our calamitous Belgian holiday. How wrong could I be?
After standing in an empty hall for about 20 minutes, watching an empty black conveyor belt go around and around, it dawned on us that our luggage wasn't arriving too. Nor was that of the ten other angry people crowding around the lost luggage desk. Easyjet weren't answering the phone.</p>
<p>Nothing to do but leave our details and get the car. We were already late and hot and now without luggage, so we drove down the coast to a beautiful stretch near the island of Tavolara. The first campsite had no room, but we got lucky at the second, where a nice gay man rented us his boyfriends caravan. As you can see it was a bit of a squeeze, but it was all we needed to survive. Pizza, red wine, bed.<br />
<br /><a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/caravan.jpg"><img width="100" height="75" border="0" src="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/images/caravan.jpg" title="Caravan" alt="Caravan" style="margin:0 5px 5px 0;float:left;" /></a> The following morning, we got up to our first proper day on holiday. Grumpy and hot. This was soon tempered by the most beautiful little beach overlooking the island. Cobalt sky, white sand and turquoise sea. Swimming in the sea it was as if everything was perfect.<br />
Sadly, a trip to the airport confirmed that my luggage was still missing and it was to be another night in the caravan with no clean clothes for me.</p>
<p>Having abandoned all hope of seeing our belongings again, a large part of day three was spent shopping for tents and clothes. I was glad of my insurance now. Mid-afternoon, just as I was looking for a sleeping bag, of course, the call came through that my luggage had arrived. After another trip to the airport, we zoomed up the coast to a new campsite, making camp shortly before dark. One final minor crisis occurred before the end of the day, when we couldn't get into the restaurant as we were too late by ten minutes. Take away pizza and beer saw out our third holiday day.</p>
<p>Day four and finally we started a day properly. Clean clothes, hot cappuccino, pasties choccolito and baking heat. We were on holiday! Swimming in the sea, driving through the mountains, eating pasta, drinking red wine. I could feel the tension releasing from my shoulders. We got the map out and planned our trip South west to the other coast for the following day.</p>
<p>There's a line from a Godfather film used in a Sopranos episode, &quot;I thought I was out. And they pulled me back in.&quot; This is pretty much how I felt when the car keys got locked in the boot the following evening! I was running out of ideas about what else could go wrong. Me, J &amp; T went to the beach, while P spent most of the next day getting that little disaster sorted out.</p>
<p>Fortunately it was a proper holiday after that. We had three trouble free days. I got over my aversion to sandals and strolled about Sardinia in them all week, very comfortably. The sea was amazing. During our final swim together, J &amp; me swam with schools of fish and even a Ray, over some rocks in shallow water. We visited Roman ruins and prehistoric sites and then a museum to get some context about what we had seen. We had great food everywhere pizza and pasta and some tremendous ice cream from small Gelaterias. On my last night, we promenaded among the stylish Italians, not quite as obviously English thanks to the sun.  </p>
<p>Yesterday, I left P J &amp; T at the airport as they headed back off for another week exploring the rest of the island. It was a beautiful and friendly island and I hope to go back sometime. <strong>(You can see more of my photos in the photo album on the right.)</strong></p>
<p>Now I'm back in Southy preparing for my Physics resit in 3 weeks time. I passed all my other exams and achieved the course average required to pass,&nbsp; (I astonished myself by getting 100% in my final piece of coursework) but this one component, my Mechanics exam, I failed and need to retake to progress. </p>
<p>Back to the books.</p>

<p>I've come to the conclusion that I'm one of the world's bigger narcissists and one of the worse ways this manifests is in the suspicion that people are out to trick me (including my own brain) and that some terrible events will unfold as a result. I'm not entirely sure how it has arisen but I realised today that I am primed to look for deliberate deceit everywhere and it's not good, cos actually there usually isn't any going on.<br />There is even my suspicion of an inner psychopath who's unseen hand is guiding my actions in the outer world according to some dastardly, yet unknown plan. The desire to see myself at the centre of events and the battle with my rational thoughts that this pivotal role in life's events is rather unlikely, seems unending. I see meaning everywhere and often multiple meanings which leaves me tongue tied and reluctant to participate in life at large. It's so much easier to stay home wrapped up safely in the narrative structures of a book about lives much more interesting than my own. More often than not a cigar is just cigar, but how does one know without taking a risk?<br />And how do I know that what I think or what I say is really what I think? Often when I review my thoughts and actions I realise it was just some base motive such greed, anger or jealousy that led to that decision branch when it all felt <em>so</em> rational at the time. Is this how killers feel after the act?<br />Other manifestations of narcissism occur in my daily fight between my attempts to be kind to my fellow humans
and wanting to tell them to get the hell out of the way when they are
blocking my path on the pavement. As though these seconds and metres
spent navigating around them are somehow vital to me, that I am somehow special and deserving of that space, when they and I are in fact
trivial and others behaviour is just natural. (There are many similar situations, please feel free to add your own to the comments section!)</p>
<p>I know, I know, I think too much and if I was busier maybe I'd be thinking about something else. Perhaps the rest of you never have these thoughts or are just too smart to share them, but they are like picking at a scab to me, much to hard to resist even if it ends up with blood everywhere.<br />This is one reason I take comfort in Maths, it can be very calming to do something with clear rules and structure and prove outcomes that are as true and unambiguous as it is possible to be. Even uncertainty and incompleteness can be understood and quantified in Maths in a way that I find impossible in the fuzziness of words and humanity.</p>
<p>So is narcissism so bad? Yes, I think so. It leads to all these good intentions that are paving the road to hell. All that time spent looking in the mirror is time away from what is around us and creates a false sense of reality. False premises for action led to.....well, you should be able to fill the sentence yourself cos the world is full of the consequences both personal and global.<br />I'm not saying introspection isn't useful, it's what I'm doing now and it makes me feel better (and stupid at the same time) but I don't know if it is possible to have a good sense of oneself and everything else at same time, maybe all my readers possess this holy grail!</p>
<p>I guess this all boils down to a big whinge about feeling certainty and the freedom I imagine that brings - I fear the Certain, like the Pope or George Bushes and of the world - but I envy them too, as they appear to feel free to live life fully uninhibited by uncertainty and a fear of the outcomes of their choices. This may be a different kind of narcissism, one where one is convinced one is right regardless of evidence, but it's a more appealing version!</p>
<p>The only cure for all this is get out amongst the people again, take the risk of interaction, make a few mistakes etc. Aversion therapy to get my tolerance levels back up after a week of solitude. I may never be comfortable amongst my fellow humans but they aren't going to go away and it doesn't look like I'll be able to become a machine any time soon. </p>
<p>Thank you for your attention, my unseen therapists, I hope to have at least provided a few laughs.<br /> </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/ftc2_2.jpg"><img width="300" height="64" border="0" src="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/images/ftc2_2.jpg" title="Ftc2_2" alt="Ftc2_2" style="margin:0 5px 5px 0;float:left;" /></a>I've been having a few angry days, culminating in the conclusion that I no longer wish to be human being, I would rather be a machine, emotionless and sexless. The final straw came when I couldn't solve a physics problem on Thursday and I felt like smashing everything in my room. Being human seems to be the primary cause of unhappiness. Eliminate that and the problem is sorted. Or does that sound too much like a serial killer!?</p>
<p>If one is a man, there are the present social advantages of power, but the problem of having to behave like a fool or brute in order to compete for a mate. If one is a woman, one is at an advantage in the mating game, by getting to do the choosing, but at a disadvantage at present in a lot of social situations, such as pay and jobs. </p>
<p>So neither seem like desirable conditions for life, especially when the result of all this seems to be finding new and innovative ways to hurt one another physically and emotionally. And personally, I particularly dislike all the emotions that come with this condition and the lack of an off switch. It's rubbish and I'm fed up.</p>
<p>The picture at the top is of the fundamental theorem of calculus. This is the general form for explaining how one variable changes with respect to another. This theorem is now one of my best friends and I'm sure we'll be spending a lot of time together in the future. It is so important because it is at the base of a whole class of problem called initial conditions problems. These occur all the time in engineering and physics.<br />One of the paradoxes of science is the impression that it can provide reduced, condensed answers to questions such as &quot;Does MMR give a child autism?&quot; In fact a lot of questions can only be answered if you have an accurate picture of the situation at the time of looking, as this will influence the answer you get, and in trying to understand how one thing changes as another does.<br />The classic example is the weather. The reason forecasts are so unreliable is that in order to accurately predict the future, everything (and I really mean everything) needs to be considered at the time of the forecast and how these variables will change and interact over the time of your forecast.<br />Another one you may be familiar with from school is the story about time travellers accidentally killing a butterfly in the past and changing the present. By killing the butterfly they had altered the initial conditions of that moment and subsequently changed what came after.<br />This is the basis of chaos theory. The word chaos is misleading as it implies things are completely random, when usually they are just very complicated - and there is a difference! Complex things can be understood, random things cannot.<br />So does MMR give a child autism? Well, what are all the variables that can cause autism and how do they interact? and how does MMR interact with the processes of a growing human? and what situation is the child in when the vaccine is to be administered? <br />As you can imagine it's hard if not impossible to get a simple answer and one that is general for all time and all people. So science isn't really reductionist in the sense most people think, because the questions cannot be framed in such a way to give really simple answers a lot of the time.</p>
<p>One problem I find with theories in other subjects is that they don't seem to think in this way. By not taking into account how everything can change from moment to moment according to underlying processes, they become snapshots of a moment rather than something explanatory about a greater process. It seems to me why politics and economics fail so badly as theories, their lack of consideration of change and the interactions between the parts that make up the world over time.</p>
<p>What has all this got to do with me be angry and wanting to be a machine? </p>
<p>Well, we are all variables (hence the title of my blog) and we all interact and change with respect to one another too and change each other in the process. And to be honest I find the complexity of it all overwhelming and demoralising a lot of the time. The lack of control, feeling helpless leading to anger etc. etc. These are not good feelings. <br />Humans are mostly conservative at heart, we like routine and structure, not change and complexity. Yet we get bored so easily if things don't change. Where is the balance?! Not at a fixed point either as far as I can tell and hence the fundmental theorem of calculus. We are caught in a function changing with time throughout our lives, over which we have influence but also influences us. Makes me angry cos I feel trapped and I don't have as much influence as I'd like. It's the same as being five years old and discovering life isn't fair, it STILL sucks! Machines don't have this problem, so I'd like to be in their gang.</p>
<p>Some days, I solve stuff and understand it and it feels good, but I can't help wondering if it'd be better not to feel at all. It's funny to me that most people have an instinctive understanding of the algebra of everyday life, but for me it's just as hard as my course.</p>
<p>I'm a week away from the end of my studies this year and I was thinking about what has changed the other day. My conclusion, is that I now ask better questions than eight months ago. It's a cycle, I ask a question - get an answer which raises new questions and round I go again. A process of refinement like polishing the surface of a stone, little by little it gets smoother and the pattern is revealed.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/tomatoseedlings.jpg"><img width="100" height="124" border="0" src="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/images/tomatoseedlings.jpg" title="Tomatoseedlings" alt="Tomatoseedlings" style="margin:0 5px 5px 0;float:left;" /></a>It's been a whole month since my classes ended and when we start again on Monday there will be just seven weeks until the exams which end the course.<br />I've been a bit short of cash, so I haven't been up to a whole lot. Mainly coming up with excuses not to study!<br />The results of&nbsp; the few occasions when I have been out can be viewed in the photo album on the right. I've become a little obsessed with Tree Shape photographs, but I thought with it now being spring, a picture of my tomato seedlings which popped through yesterday, would be more appropriate than bleak silhouettes.</p>
<p>So I've slowly been getting my allotment into shape, pictures to come next time, taking me three hours to dig a nine metre by one metre trench. It made me remember just how hard digging is and pity the poor soldiers in World War One for that alone. Potatoes, carrots and onions are in so far, but I've still got about two thirds of the plot to dig over so it'll take some time to sort out.</p>
<p>I've also had plenty of time to read and if there is only one book you read this year, I implore you to read &quot;How Mumbo Jumbo Conquered the World&quot; by Francis Wheen. (There's a link to Amazon on the right.) As good a polemic as The Female Eunuch, it gives a blistering critique of inductive reasoning and the susceptibility of one and all to personal or collective delusions in the face of evidence. It's also a promotion of Enlightment ideas: of human rights, rationalism and empiricism<br />Pretty much everyone from the last 200 years gets a kicking left, right and centre. From free marketeers, to X files fans, to Noam Chomsky. And even though he's chastising us, he actually made me laugh, if some what bleakly with gems such as, &quot;...people use the word &quot;guru&quot; only because &quot;charlatan&quot; is too long.&quot; or recalling books such as &quot;Make It So: Management Lessons from Star Trek The Next Generation&quot;. Or how about Alan Sokals rebuke to cultural relativists, &quot;Fair enough:anyone who believes that the laws of physics are mere social conventions is invited to try transgressing those conventions from the window of my apartment. I live on the twenty first floor.&quot;<br />As someone who has believed all sorts of nonsense in my time, as well as being an enjoyable read, it was a reminder of the dangers of wishful thinking. That wanting something to be true isn't enough to make it true and that the continued repetition of a fallacy can lead to terrible consequences on both personal and global levels.</p>
<p>You may find much of it offensive or disagreeable, but it should give you food for thought about your own beliefs.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"><span><a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/allotment_2.jpeg"><img width="100" height="135" border="0" src="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/images/allotment_2.jpeg" title="Allotment_2" alt="Allotment_2" style="margin:0 5px 5px 0;float:left;" /></a>It's
been a tough six weeks or so since the start of Semester Two and the
End of Semester One and my first big hurdle, the Maths A exam. I
scraped in with a pass, but like a driving test, a pass is a pass and
that is the most important thing.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"><span>The
general saying here is that to pass this Foundation year is the same
as doing three A-levels in a year and getting grade A in all of them,
as that is the entry requirement for the science and engineering
degrees at Southampton.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"> <span>The
last few weeks has raised quite a few doubts in my mind about what I
am doing here. Partly because it is very hard and partly because I
have a much better idea of what academic life is really about and
what the next few years is likely to be like. </span>
</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"> <span>The
real thing we are being taught here is to think in a particular way.
A logical scientific way, and I find it incredibly difficult
sometimes and I'm even unsure of whether I like it sometimes too.
There is a certain relentlessness to the learning here as well, every
week another test and new set of arguments to absorb.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"><span>One
of our tutors talked about the difference between learning by rote,
facts and formulas and real problem solving. He said a real life
problem is something one often has no idea how to approach at the
start and one has to find a way (or give up!) What they are trying to
instil in us are the necessary thinking skills to approach any
problem that science has developed over centuries.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"><span>The
reason they can be so hard to obtain, is that they often are not
intuitive and require conceptual leaps that are difficult to adjust
to. This reason is also why science/engineering graduates can obtain
well paid jobs, often in unrelated areas, as they should be good
problem solvers regardless of field.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"> <span>This
semester we have been learning about: how things rotate and move and
collide – for example I learnt how to describe the way the Earth
behaves, due to forces of momentum, mathematically in terms of
vectors. I've been learning how waves behave and how electricity acts
as a field.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"><span>All
things that may seem quite baffling at first glance and although the
explanations follow step upon step of logical deduction a la Sherlock
Holmes, it is like being in a totally dark room and trying to
understand what it look likes.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"><span>When
I watch a tutor so fluidly explain some phenomena from simple
Mathematical principles into something complex step by step, such as
our Mechanics tutor explaining planetary motion this week, it does
produce a sense of awe in me and a sense that I am witnessing
natures' true form. But when I'm presented with a problem to solve
and twenty minutes to do it, despair is more common!</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"><span>It
is both inspiring and daunting to be shown how much there is to
learn, even just to get started on this journey and I find myself
wondering if I am capable of travelling that path or how far I'll be
able to go. It is a privilege in my eyes to have the opportunity to
try, but I wouldn't describe myself as enjoying it at present and
despite often being told I have potential, I am a long way from
showing results on that supposed potential.</span></p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;"> <span>I
haven't really had time for much else but studying and I'm feeling
the financial pinch after six months, so that probably hasn't helped.
</span>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;"><span>With
spring on the way, in the absence of a garden, I am planning to get
an allotment! I decided I needed an outdoor space to grow some
vegetables and flowers and just somewhere to sit and read outside. So
hopefully I'll have some pictures of that to come and maybe I'll
eventually look like the man in the top left picture.</span><br /><br /> </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/boxingdaybeach.JPG"><img width="100" height="133" border="0" alt="Boxingdaybeach" title="Boxingdaybeach" src="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/images/boxingdaybeach.JPG" style="margin:0 5px 5px 0;float:left;" /></a>Although the University is quite nice, Southampton itself is by far the ugliest place I have ever lived! So it's difficult to come up with any pictures that show it in a good light. </p>
<p>Instead, I'm posting a picture from our Boxing day walk by the sea in Devon. The light was amazing, with the sun low and golden. This was at about 2pm, about 13 hours after the Tsunami in Asia, but before I knew about it, which gives the picture of a velvety sea in Devon an odd frame of reference time wise.</p>
<p>The other picture is of my first computer, which I built in our Electronics class two weeks ago. I was very proud of it. It could count to 4! (We connected two together so it could count to 8.) Described simply, by controlling the flow of electricity through the circuit (all those <a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/alistair_board_2.JPG"><img width="100" height="75" border="0" alt="Alistair_board_2" title="Alistair_board_2" src="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/images/alistair_board_2.JPG" style="margin:0 5px 5px 0;float:left;" /></a>bits of wire and the coloured lumps) the green and red lights can be made to switch on and off to represent binary (one or zero) numbers. <br /> This in itself may not seem very exciting, but essentially the same process, scaled by many orders of magnitude, is what is allowing you to read this message or your washing machine to work or anything that uses a computer to function. <br />
I always find something magical in actually making a theory (Boolean logic &amp; electricity) into something that actually works from inert parts, which is I guess why I like engineering, so this was a very satisfying experiment. A real example of how complexity can arise from simplicity. <br />
The history of Electricity is another hidden and very interesting history in itself, as it has had profound effects of the shape of our society, and yet has only been a part of everyday life since the 1920's when the National Grid was installed.</p>
<p>
Going back to my opening remark, the reason for Southampton being so horrible, is really down to World War 2. It was the second most bombed place in the country and was only two raids away from being abandoned and the city relocated elsewhere! The postwar reconstruction has been a really awful mixture of bad concrete and red brick laid around the few Victorian remains, which has recently begun to be replaced with functional but anodyne late 20th century design. The overall effect is one of a complete lack of identity or continuity in it's layout. They should really knock it all down and start again with some decent architects!</p>
<p>
On the course we've just started Semester 2, having had a nasty 3 hour Maths exam to end Semester 1 last week. I do not feel at all confident about passing, but have to wait a couple of weeks before I find out. I'm still too slow.</p>
<p>
This Semester will be all about Calculus, which for the uninitiated is all about understanding change. How one thing changes with respect to another, often how a very small change in one thing can lead to a large change in something else. A simple example being how the speed of your car (on the speedometer) describes the change in space (along the road) with respect to time. So a measure of 50 mph describes a faster change than 30 mph.<br />
Like all Maths, it's much less frightening in reality than it sounds. In the fact the whole reason behind the science project is to make things easier to understand and if they aren't that is a failing of science not an intention. Given we live in a world where things are constantly changing, this is a fundamental process in describing all aspects of the world.</p>
<p>
Also I have to write another computer programme. This time a group project, in which my colleagues have elected to write a program that allows the user to calculate the flight of a projectile. Sounds worryingly like a military programme! But it's all physics! (I wanted to write a program to help me calculate how fast I could ride my motorbike around a bend, but sadly it was a bit too complicated....)</p>

<p>
After some interesting responses to my last dispatch, my original plans for this email were to pick up where I left off and write about things such as how engineering demonstrates the use of machines to solve problems once believed to only be understandable via intellectual (philosophical) means. Or how the kind of science and engineering done is biased simply by the lack of balance between the sexes amongst scientists and engineers i.e. it's nearly all men.<br />
It was going to be the empiricist strikes back, but I'm too tired to string logical arguments together, so it's just a collection of trivia and general babble instead:</p>
<p>
Trivial fact number one: The first fibre optic cable was invented at Southampton University. The backbone of modern communications, invented here. This email doubtless passed through some on it's way to you.<br />
Trivial fact two: Tim Berners Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web has just joined Southampton University Computer Science department.<br />
And fact number three, just for my former colleagues: Finsbury Square (home of Bloomberg TV) was the original site for the Bedlam Lunatic Asylum designed by Robert Hooke, inventor of the microscope amongst other things. That last fact won't mean much to anyone who doesn't work in TV, but I thought it&nbsp; a suitably ironic location for Bloomberg.</p>
<p>
So after twelve weeks of learning, I've been starting to worry about all the things I don't know. It's as if for every question addressed, 100 more spring up to be answered and it's overwhelming sometimes. When I put this to my Physics tutor, he said the nicest thing that's been said to me since being here: in his experience the best scientists are the ones who worry about what they don't understand. It's the ones who don't worry he worries about! <br />
That made me feel a whole lot better.</p>
<p>
The subjects we've been covering this term are: Maths, Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Electricity &amp; Electronics and Computer Applications.<br />
Maths is the language of reality. It's aim is to describe things, as I wrote about last time. I love the way it is true in a way that nothing else in life can be, but it really winds me up when I can't grasp it. And like any language, it's all about practise, there's no other way, which a lot of people find dull.<br />
Mechanics &amp; Thermodynamics are more straightforward, as parts of it are quite intuitive. Mechanics is really about how things move and interact with each other, thermodynamics being about the behaviour of heat. Most stuff moves and gets hot, so it covers a lot of stuff!<br />
Electricity &amp; Electronics is conceptually as hard as Maths as it is about something that we see the effects of, but can't be seen or touched directly. So we've been learning the fundamentals of how the things we all use work, such as the computer you are reading this on, so that I could actually get some lumps of metal and design and build stuff with enough understanding. </p>
<p>
My tutor said a couple of weeks ago, &quot;...a theory is a logical deduction based upon a set of assumptions. Therefore a theory cannot be proved or disproved.&quot; But it can be tested with experiments to test it's reliability. The purpose of these areas of study is to make logical deductions that then allow you to do things like build a computer, because of their accuracy. It's useful to think about the historical context to all these things: A lot of what I am learning are things people deduced hundreds or even thousands of years ago and are still considered reliable today. Which is remarkable, if you consider science is like trying to describe the contents of a room you've never seen while wearing a blindfold and boxing gloves. So what I'm learning in these subjects, is the distilled knowledge of many years of scientific research and of those researching today, who will provide the ideas that give us the new technologies that we can use or abuse as we wish.</p>
<p>
Computer Applications has two purposes, to teach us how to use computers better: I have to write my first programme over Xmas. And to teach us how to present our ideas. The second point makes me feel more optimistic about the future of science and engineering. The coming generations of scientists and engineers will hopefully be as adept at communicating their ideas as anyone else, and this will I hope go some way to changing the general perceptions around science. However, my pessimistic side feels that the world is just becoming increasingly narcissistic and is more interested in subjective experience than objective reality. Indeed, my interpretation of the Universe science presents is quite a melancholy view: a universe where there is no special meaning to it all or any real significance to a life beyond evolutionary pressures, so I can see that these theories may not sit well with most people.</p>
<p>
I've been to look around the Physics and Maths departments, with a view to changing my degree. Maths is most appealing, partly because the Mathematicians are the nicest people! and partly as it is the only really satisfying subject as regards proof. But I don't think I'm really smart enough to do a whole four years of mental gymnastics. By the way, trivial fact number four is that Maths Graduates have the best employment statistics of all graduates, the argument being that if you can do Maths you can do pretty much anything, but I reckon it's just cos they compile the statistics. I'll let you decide....<br />
Also, I'm not sure it really is the best use of the approx 2100 weeks I have left to live, when I could be discovering how to supply the whole world with clean water in Civil Engineering or something equally useful. (Not that it really matters according to my previous statement.)</p>
<p>
The only decent photo opportunity recently I was without my camera. It was about two weeks ago at about 4 o'clock, when I was outside and looked up into a darkening bruise blue sky as amber sunlight was just colouring the top of the Law Building. It was as if the daylight was clinging onto the building against the too soon coming night. And would have been a great picture. </p>

<p>
Instead I thought I'd write a (rather long) summary of the last few hectic weeks on the chance that people are interested in what I am actually doing at University:</p>
<p>
Essentially this year is a foundation year in Maths &amp; Physics. But time also spent on learning how to learn, a much underestimated skill and probably the hardest adjustment to make. So as well as all the lectures and workshops on Maths, we learn about strategies to absorb all the information and skills on presenting information, such as how to write a formal report using Excel &amp; Word and how to do a presentation with Power-point. This is quite an interesting area in it's own right because even in just writing this email it is difficult to convey information in a clear manner, so for graduates seeking work or presenting their research this is important skill to have and I've found it surprising how difficult it can be to do.</p>
<p>
Which links nicely to writing about science, as it has suffered a lot, in my opinion, from a poor ability to present itself as to what it is and as worthwhile subject to the population at large. I get the impression most people either don't see it's relevance to them or consider it the tool of evil capitalists to make the world a bad place.</p>
<p>
To start thinking about science, here's a gem one of my lecturers came out with the other day, &quot;Definitions are the only things that can be said to be true. Everything else is just theory. And definitions are only true because we say so!&quot;</p>
<p>
A kilogramme, a metre, a mile, are all just definitions that we as humans have agreed upon because it is useful for us to do so. So what about everything else? Living now, at this end of history, we reap the rewards (and pitfalls) of all the humans that have come before us and the best inheritance they have given us is the results of their <em>investigations. </em>The people that asked why and how over and over, probably driving their parents insane at the time, all of their results combined and checked and repeated and <em>described </em>are what makes our world the way it is today. Ten years ago I'd never sent an email, but now thanks to scientists and engineers that are still alive and all those that have gone before I can write to as many people as I wish at once.<br />
The reason I italicised the words &quot;investigation&quot; and &quot;described&quot; is that is essentially what science boils down to. We investigate things with a view to describing them. However, going back to human history, we've evolved languages to describe our everyday experience as social animals, so we needed to invent a way of describing things that we don't experience directly in our lives and to describe things in a universal way. Or to put it another way, to describe abstract concepts and produce a systematic form of representation. Analogies are very useful things, but unfortunately there comes a point where it just doesn't work to say &quot;It's like...&quot; and if the language to describe the thing itself doesn't exist, then we must invent it. Which is why we invented Maths. <br />
So if you aren't bored already, the point of all this is to give some sense of where science comes from and then hopefully bring a further sense of why it is relevant to everyone. I hope this is all not too obvious and patronising.</p>
<p>
We all do investigations and we all describe things all the time, whether it's finding the best bargain or telling someone why you think a painting is great. <br />
For scientists and engineers we had to develop a systematic way of doing this, because if we hadn't it would be impossible to interpret someone's work or build a car and be confident it wouldn't explode as soon as it is started.<br />
So learning Maths is really learning a language, but it is a language that can describe the physical universe and everything in it. Us included. And because we're trying to describe something we are part of, it requires a lot conceptual thinking, which is pretty tricky for a hairy ape that's really better at hunting and gathering than thinking. However to have a language that can be used to describe everything is a very powerful tool for solving all sorts of problems.<br />
For example the Head of our course is an Acoustic Engineer. Her research into acoustics is with an aim to developing a way of diagnosing bronchitis by listening to the sounds produced in the chest. This would be used to create a device for use in Refugee Camps for triage purposes without needing a doctor present, and ultimately save lives by preventing the disease spreading.</p>
<p>
Maths, Physics and Engineering really are the basis of modern life as we experience it today. Everything thing we have and take for granted from communications (just the ability to share an idea globally), to health and sanitation could not have come into existence or be maintained without it. <br />
So what I am learning on a day to day basis are the core components of the language needed to understand the physical world. So we a lot of time spent practising solving equations and learning what patterns have been spotted and developed into theories that describe the universe, such the properties of energy or matter. Also we learn where the limits of current knowledge are.<br />
It isn't a moral framework and it isn't a project that is ever likely to end and it is impossible for any individual to know in detail more than a small fraction of the whole, but because it is so powerful, it is in everyone's interest to have some understanding of science. It can be used or abused in all areas of human life.</p>
<p>
It is really hard work too! We study for 40 hours week in total and I'm exhausted at the end of most days from having to think so hard. <br />
Nominally, I have been accepted to go forward to study Civil and Environmental Engineering, as I think there are a lot of interesting problems to work on involving the environment we live in, but I have the possibility to change to any other area if I pass the course. To do that I have to get at least 60% in all exams and course work.</p>
<p>
That's enough I think and I hope it hasn't been too dull, but I couldn't think of how to explain things without some context. I'll try for more pictures and less words next time.</p>

So it's taken me a while to getting round to sending an email to say thank-you to everyone for such a great send off last week. I enjoyed myself thoroughly.</p>
<p>
Needless to say it's a bit of a culture shock arriving here. I started moving on Sunday, but didn't finish until Monday night. Since then it has been endless rounds of phone calls, emails and bureaucracy to get everything sorted out, I even have a lock-up for my Motorbike, just like Arthur Daley. <br />
I've yet to get a timetable, but I finally met my fellow students today and they are just what you'd expect: a few Kurt Cobain T-shirts, lots of silly hair, 19-year old boys with really bad beards and even one young man in a big trilby hat. Nice to see someone cutting their own fashion path in the world, but I won't be following him. I only spotted about half a dozen women out of nearly a hundred, so I guess engineering, Maths and Physics is stills a boys world.</p>
<p>My studio flat is really nice, but it is small. The picture of the Gower from outside looks best, my flat is on the end, the first two bits sticking out.</p>
<p><a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/sculpture_2.JPG"><img width="100" height="133" border="0" src="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/images/sculpture_2.JPG" title="Sculpture_2" alt="Sculpture_2" style="margin:0 5px 5px 0;float:left;" /></a>The campus is really nice too, lots of trees and plants and sculptures dotted about like I've included here. There's a gallery and theatre too as well as top notch sporting facilities for 50 quid a year all in. I'm ashamed to say I haven't made it too the Student Union bar yet, so I can't report on the price of the beer.</p>
<p>Anyway, next week I start studying for real and actually I'm looking forward to that as it's all been a bit stressful and boring moving house and enrolling. Bring on the calculus! I<br />shall send another dispatch soon....</p>

Engineering with First Class Honours. I got my results for the year today and they are as follows:</p><p>

</tbody></table>
<p>Which is an average of 75% for the year, having dipped down to 69% back in Febraury.</p><p>I might write at a later time saying what I think about all
this, but I don’t really know what to say right now, except that if you have
children or are planning to, start saving now.</p>
<p>I was trying to think of a way to illustrate some of what I’ve
been doing in all this time, other than these posts I’ve written. My report for
my individual project can be downloaded <a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/files/2d_viv_ammended_final_report_long_toc.pdf" target="_blank">here (3Mb PDF)</a>. It’s not light reading, but
the abstract and introduction should be accessible to everyone as an example of
degree level engineering work – there are still a couple of typos in the
equations. And lest it seem too esoteric, the wider context is that one
consequence of understanding the kind of problem in this project is that it influences
the cost of oil extraction and ultimately fuel prices, a subject close to many people’s
wallets. Whether we should be extracting the oil at all is another matter...</p>
<p>The next step could be Plans A, B, C or D. Plans A and B are
both PhDs: One being the computer modelling of irrigation systems I wrote about
in my last dispatch, the second being a bit of a change of direction. It’s also
computer modelling, but the design and simulation of biological systems,
specifically the human immune system as a guide to future experimentation
relating to cancer research. This arose out of a conversation in the pub with a
member of the swimming club who is looking for a student to take this on. I’m
going for an interview on Tuesday and it may be a bridge too far in terms of
transferable skills, but the money is in place and it answers two of my
fundamental questions – is it interesting? And is it useful? So it’s not impossible
that I’ll end up with a PhD in Medical Science, which kind of makes sense in my
crooked life.</p>
<p>Plans C &amp; D involve either getting a job or fulfilling
my ultimate fantasy of divesting myself of all my possessions and finding some
way to step outside the system that doesn’t involve becoming a hippy and
believing in nonsense.</p>
<p>After I finished my last bit of studying I went camping in
Folkestone for the weekend which coincided with the opening of the <a href="http://www.folkestonetriennial.org.uk/" target="_blank">Folkestone Triennial</a>. This event it turns out is largely down
to Roger De Haan, local resident and heir to the Saga empire and who is
obviously a keen art lover, judging from the amount of Art-based urban regeneration
on display and the line-up of Artists taking part. It’s all outdoors
installations and if the weather&#039;s good, it’s worth a day exploring the town to
see them – I enjoyed it anyway. The camp site was overlooking the beach and we
could clearly see France twinkling in the distance at night. With the sound of
the waves and the moon reflecting on the water, who’d have thought Folkestone
could be so romantic? The picture above is of the Beach Huts made from a Pitch
and Putt Golf Course. I’ve grown to love concrete more and more over the last
four years and that’s one parallel I can make between engineering and art, the
more one understands what one is looking at, the better the appreciation of its
relative merits and faults. I definitely see the world in a different way now
that I know a little of what all this everyday stuff that makes up my
environment is and how it works. There are some more pictures in the scrapbook.</p>
<p><span>Recently read,
viewed, listened to and appreciated:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Air-Gollancz-S-F-Geoff-Ryman/dp/0575078111/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1213956344&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Air – Geoff Ryman</a>. I really liked this speculation about the
effects of technology on poor communities, as one reviewer has said this is the
sort of book that shouldn’t be seen as genre fiction and deserves to be
promoted up with whatever people are calling literature these days.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Left-Hand-Darkness-Ursula-Guin/dp/1857230744/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1213956378&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">The Left Hand of Darkness – Ursula Le Guin</a>. Likewise, I can’t
believe how much of a latecomer I am to the work of Ursula Le Guin. She blows
me away with her writing and if Doris Lessing can get a Nobel Prize then she
deserves one too. It must be the awful covers that put people off. It took me a
while to get going with this as she throws the reader into an alien world with
no preparation so that we experience the alienness of the place and alienation
of the narrator who is also alien in this world. She is such a human writer, by
which I mean that she takes time to explain and understand the motivations of
all the characters for good or bad rather than writing in archetypes or
stereotypes. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Victory-Conditions-Vattas-Elizabeth-Moon/dp/1841495980/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1213954837&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Victory Conditions – Elizabeth Moon</a>. The final book in this space-war
series, which have been great fun and easy reading as she writes in a very
straightforward way, yet linger in my mind as they have been all about members
of a family of strong women and told from their relative points of view. So
there’s lots of stuff about female attitudes to violence and the struggles to
be taken seriously in their society, but like the Wire, one never feels like
one is being preached to and it adds to the drama rather than subtracts from
it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Northline-Willy-Vlautin/dp/0571235700/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1213956411&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Northline – Willy Vlautin</a>. Neil gave me this one for my
birthday and it comes with a soundtrack CD. Which I have to say works really
well as another dimension to the book when I had it on while reading. A sad,
tragic tale with a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel about Allison
Johnson and her life in contemporary North America.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Red-Men-Matthew-Abaitua/dp/190500558X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1213956444&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">The Red Men – Matthew de Abaitua</a>. A dystopian London novel,
which was really good for the first two thirds, but then never really seemed to
go anywhere for me. He’s a funny and talented writer though and it was
entertaining to read about places I know well filtered through his near future
visions of life in the UK. </p>
<p>I’ve had so much new music to listen to over the last couple
of months, I’ll just make a couple of honourable mentions here that have been getting a lot of play recently and the rest can
go in the side bar.</p>
<p>The Midnight Organ Fight – <a href="http://www.myspace.com/frightenedrabbit" target="_blank">Frightened Rabbit</a></p>
<p>The Evangelist - <a href="http://www.robertforster.net/" target="_blank">Robert Forster</a> </p>
<p>TV has been a dead zone with the exception of the
transmission of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346336/" target="_blank">The Best of Youth</a> on BBC Four which I’ve wanted to see for some
time. A tremendous six hour Italian epic about the life of one family over
forty years, split into four parts for TV. Despite being a little bit soap
opera on occasions and subject to the necessary plot contrivances that stretch the
suspension of disbelief, the characterisation was so good it was very moving,
funny and life affirming and taught me more about the recent history of a
society of which I’m largely ignorant. Track it down if you can, once you get
into it I guarantee you’ll want to watch it all the way through.</p>
<p>I’ve also been onto series 4 of The Wire on DVD, excellent
as ever, this series is focused on the educational and political systems.</p><p>So that&#039;s it for now, maybe I&#039;ll have a proper rant when it finally feels real and I know what I feel about it all. And when I know what happens next.</p>

<p>Yesterday after 10 weeks of training I ran what turned out to be my first race in years, a 10km (6.22 miles) run around the Bay in Bournemouth. I initially thought I'd just signed up for a charity run, but it turned out to be a proper race. Fortunately the weather came good and it was a beautiful spring day to run beside the sea. The only hiccup being the last minute discovery that public transport here doesn't start early enough on a Sunday to get me the 30 miles from Southampton to Bournemouth before 9am, so I had to hire a car. Is this the 21st Century?! </p>
<p>Anyhow, I ran round in 39 minutes 15 seconds, which met my target of going under 40 minutes. That corresponds with an average pace of 3:56 per km or 6:20 per mile. I'm well pleased with that as it's something I've wanted to do for a few years now. Training works, there is no substitute. And in many ways the training has been more important than the race was, as it's reignited my love of running. Interestingly, if I'd been able to run the pace I ran in training (3:45 per km) I'd have gone round in 37min 30s, which goes to show the effects of pressure on performance. I am kind of fascinated by the effect of ones state of mind on all sorts of things. I knew because of my accelerometer that I wasn't going as fast as I can, but I didn't feel that I could go any faster at the time.</p>
<p>You can check out the full results <a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/files/0330_Bournemouth_Bay_Run_10K.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. I officially finished 15th overall out 851 runners (or 10th position out of 258 men in the general mens class as an alternative measure, but there were 5 men in the over 35's classes faster than me) and it's no false modesty to say that this is more a reflection on the quality of the field than on my performance. It was quite exciting (and a bit weird) running up to finish by the pier with hundreds of people clapping and the announcer calling my name and number over the tannoy.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has offered their thoughts and advice in response to my previous post about Phd's. I've decided to take it on and am in the process of submitting the application. I won't know until around August whether it is definitely going ahead as I need to do well enough in my degree and the department won't make a decision about funding until sometime around then. My potential supervisor seems sufficiently optimistic that it will go ahead though that he has taken the research topic for which I have applied off the website. So here's some information as to what it's all about - in a kind of round the houses explanation:</p>
<p>The topic I'm applying to do research into is the application of queuing theory to irrigation. </p>
<p>Shooting straight off at a tangent, let me begin with a bit of motivation theory from 1943 with Maslow's 'Hierarchy of Needs' in which he reasoned five levels of needs that act as motivational forces in peoples lives:</p>
<p>1. Physical: Freedom from thirst and hunger</p>
<p>2. Security: absence of fear</p>
<p>3. Social: the need to feel accepted and wanted by others</p>
<p>4. Esteem: the need for personal recognition and respect</p>
<p>5. Self-actualisation: the need for personal fulfilment</p>
<p>This isn't a theory I hold in particular high regard and I've only used it for the purposes of this explanation as it is illustrative of the kinds of differences that different people will be experiencing depending on their circumstances. Most people, if not all of you, reading this are living at level 5 according to this theory and me too. And doing a Phd is definitely a level 5 activity. However the subject of my Phd speaks (rather indirectly) to level 1 and for many people, if not the majority of people on the planet, trying to meet levels 1 and 2 are their everyday experience. Which is not to say that I think this is any more worthy than other subject areas, but hopefully it gives you some idea of how it fits into the realm of human endeavour. Even for those of us living most of our lives at the upper levels of needs we are most likely going to experience large increases in the costs of food soon due to pressures on several fronts: increasing global population, climate change effects leading to the decrease in the supplies of fresh water and climate change effects leading to crop failures through increased droughts and floods. Hence good management of irrigation systems in order to grow food is likely to be of increasing importance. <br /> </p>
<p>For example, you may or may not be aware <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7319589.stm" target="_blank">rice prices are at an all time high</a> at the moment as demand outstrip supply. It takes 10,000 tonnes of water to produce 1 kg of rice, which you can think about by imagining that 1kg of water is two small half litre bottles of Evian and 10,000 tonnes of water is 10,000 kg of water or 20,000 small bottles of Evian for a 1kg packet of rice. Meeting need 1 for everyone is therefore a major logistical and economic challenge.</p>
<p>And across the hierarchy of needs, when things go wrong on level 1, it's all bets off further up the pyramid and that leads to all sorts of other problems that may not be immediately obvious, such the effects on <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/csd/csd13/documents/bground_2.pdf" target="_blank">gender equality</a> or war in <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6904318.stm" target="_blank">Darfur</a> due to issues around water. So although it's not something that will be on the minds of most people in developed countries most of the time, the effects of level 1 problems reach us eventually in the form of higher food prices or increased levels of refugees and acts as an obstacle to solving many problems related to inequality. I'm not saying providing everyone with enough to eat and drink is going to put Nuts magazine or the Pope out of business, but it gives people one less thing to worry about and then they may have the time to learn or do something that might empower them to take the idiots to task if they wish.</p>
<p>Much of the focus of the climate change discussions are - quite rightly - concerned with energy and irrigation is a pretty unfashionable subject, especially in this country where irrigation is largely unnecessary at present. However, I'm of the view, for the reasons already mentioned, that it is a subject that will be of increasing importance in the future, both here and globally - everyone needs to eat. Which brings me back to the Phd itself, irrigation and queuing theory:</p>
<p>At the moment I know little about either! But essentially irrigation is really about taps. You turn the tap on to water your farm and when you've got enough water you turn the tap off again. What could be simpler? </p>
<p>Queuing on the other hand is all about supermarket tills. You go to the supermarket and queue up to buy your goods at one of the several tills you have to choose from and sooner or later you get through and go home. Again, simple enough.</p>
<p>Here's the trick - say you have 20 people, all with a different amounts of shopping and only 5 tills. What is the best way to serve everyone? First come first serve? Allocate the people to the tills so that the quantity of shopping is spread evenly amongst all of them? Serve those with the least shopping first?</p>
<p>Replace the shoppers with farmers needing water and the tills with an irrigation network and you have what is a deceptively simple concept for a really tricky problem for a Phd. (Change it slightly and it's a also a problem for a Manager at Tesco's or the designer of TV Mutliplexing System.) </p>
<p>At present most irrigation is done by opening the taps so everyone gets the same amount of water at the same time regardless of need, which is both inefficient and bad for the environment. This <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=25.928407,69.246826&amp;spn=7.100277,14.677734&amp;t=h&amp;z=7" target="_blank">link </a>to a satellite picture of Pakistan shows a white patch at the bottom. It is in fact a salt pan, where all the salt washed out of the soils, because of the irrigation method described, to the north of it and have been carried downstream and deposited there. Look at the scale! Much of the green to the north is irrigated land that would otherwise be desert. One of my lecturers said it took three hours to fly over the irrigated land when he visited, such is the scale. Imagine how much water is wasted (think of the one kilo of rice) using current methods and what washing all those nutrients, fertilisers, pesticides and salts out does to the environment and it gives you some idea why this is not a trivial problem.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why, if what I've said is correct, no-one has addressed this already? The answer to that is that the problem is both hard to solve theoretically (it takes a long time to solve even simple models at present) and more importantly, it's not cost-effective as a practical proposition at present, so there hasn't be any economic driving force to come up with a solution (except for some places in the U.S. where they have the money and impetus to start trying more sophisticated methods due to drought). However as I've tried to make a case for the future,I expect that this will change and that irrigation methods will have to change as a matter of necessity - which in my opinion is usually why anything gets done, as the invisible hand of self-interest gives us a shove. In the meantime then this is a Phd that aims to develop theory, but I would hope that it eventually becomes part of applied real life engineering solutions. </p>
<p>I can't honestly say I've got high expectations of doing a Phd filling a level 5 need (or 3 or 4 for that matter) but it seems like it's worth a go. My TV work does address aspects of 3 and 4 and I hope to keep that up for years to come. And maybe it'll lead somewhere interesting and be a small contribution along the way to addressing the problems I've outlined. It is really through the cumulative efforts of many people making small contributions that things usually get done after all, whether it's feeding everyone, putting a TV programme on the air or enacting ideological change.</p>
<p>On the cultural front I finally got round to seeing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_Will_Be_Blood" target="_blank">There Will be Blood! </a>which while very good, like No Country for Old Men and Mad Man, it was a very male experience of a particular type - not the kind of experience I've had in my own life - interesting nonetheless, but I feel like I need something new and something that engages me emotionally. TWBB certainly had echoes of Citizen Kane, but I'm not sure I go along with this, 'changes the nature of narrative cinema' argument I've been reading about.</p>
<p>The aforementioned <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/madmen/" target="_blank">Mad Men</a> on BBC4 has taken a while for me to get into as none of the characters are very likeable, but it's grown on me and it is a beautifully crafted piece of TV. </p>
<p>Two other bits of TV I finally caught up with and surprised me in that I thought they actually lived up to the hype were <a href="http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/B/boya/" target="_blank">Boy A</a> and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/gavinandstacey/" target="_blank">Gavin &amp; Stacey</a>. Boy A - more male behaviour focused drama! - was as good a bit of British TV drama as I've seen, while Gavin &amp; Stacey has made me laugh more than any comedy in a long time. It falls flat occasionally, but then comes back with some great gag that makes me forget the less good ones.</p>
<p>Books wise I've recently enjoyed one existential crime novel by one of my favourite writers James Sallis: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Drive-James-Sallis/dp/1842431145/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1206889405&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Drive</a>. And one non-fiction read <a href="http://www.survivalofthesickestthebook.com/" target="_blank">Survival of Sickest</a> (props to Anna) which explores the relationship between diseases and human evolution.</p>

</p>
<p>Got my Semester One Module Results, these are combined results for exams and coursework:</p>
<p>Geotechnical Engineering 76%<br />Structural Analysis 71%<br />Hydrology &amp; Water Resources Engineering 59%</p>
<p>That's an average of 69% and leaves me 1% off a first class degree, so I need to try and get my average up during this semester if I'm going to hit that target. A 2:1 overall may be more realistic, but it would be frustrating when I'm so close! It's going to be a really tough few months.</p>
<p>I'm really pleased with Structures cos over the years that has been my worst subject - up 6% on last summer. And conversely I'm pretty disappointed with Hydrology as the water resources area is the one I'm most interested in and I would have expected to do better. I put that down to having a bad day in the exam (worth 90% of the total mark) having got 85% in the coursework.<br />Geotechnical Engineering was all (really hard!) coursework and I'm up 9% on last summer.</p>
<p>Next week I plan to talk to my potential supervisor again and make a decision as to whether to apply for a Phd here.</p>
<p>This semester features four modules: Management, Hydraulics, Group Design Project and the continuation of my Individual Project from semester one. The latter being the biggest cause of stress as (as well as being worth double credits) it involves designing and carrying out an experiment. I had hoped to be at the analysis stage, but I'm still stuck on the getting the experiment to work and gathering some useful data. It is a little taste of what Phd work would be like and is a bit of an emotional roller coaster as things go well and go wrong - mostly wrong it seems! - and I'm running out of time and still feel like I don't know what I'm doing...</p>
<p>The Design Project is to design a pedestrian and cycle bridge and has been relaxing by comparison, as I've got to spend some time drawing, but the constraints of the design brief mean that'll it probably be quite a boring final design. Really not overly interested though, just want to get a good mark.</p>
<p>Management is kind of interesting, as an insight into the theories of how to run a business properly. It covers current rules for disciplinary and grievance procedures, theories of motivation and the numerical methods that are (supposed!) to accurately cost a project. Some of this spills over into everyday life in dealing with people generally and managing a domestic budget. It's also interesting to contrast the theory with my own experiences as an employee.</p>
<p>Hydraulics this semester is concerned with flood alleviation&nbsp; and the effects of building structures in terms of causing or alleviating floods. This may not sound particularly exciting, but as well as doing some interesting Maths, we get to look at a real problem down at Brockenhurst in the New Forest and have to come up with a solution. Personally, I find this kind of thing (albeit just as an exercise) by far the most interesting stuff we get to do. </p>
<p>I've managed to get out to the cinema a couple of times and I really liked <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_%28film%29">Juno</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Country_for_Old_Men_%28film%29">No Country for Old Men</a> was excellent, if incredibly violent, bleak and male. I found it really uncomfortable to watch.</p>
<p>On DVD I've enjoyed <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Scanner_Darkly_%28film%29">A Scanner Darkly</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Zodiac_%28film%29">Zodiac</a> and I finished watching <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_%28TV_series%29">Firefly</a>. No-one else I know seems to like <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon">Josh Whedon</a> stuff, but I really like his writing and think it's actually quite subtle and clever for what it is. I plan to re-watch <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_%28film%29">Serenity</a> now I've seen the series.</p>
<p>The fourth series of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire_%28TV_series%29">The Wire</a> is out on DVD in March, so other than my new running shoes and the prospect of a new <a target="_blank" href="http://www.portishead.co.uk/">Portishead</a> album in April, this is my greatest source of excitement! What a life I lead. The fifth and final series is on the air in the U.S. at the moment and I'll have to wait until 2009 for that to reach these shores.</p>
<p>Not much time for reading novels of late, so nothing new that was really good to recommend.</p>
<p>Music I've been enjoying recently: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.myspace.com/okkervilriver">Okkervil River</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kranky.net/artists/strategy.html">Strategy</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.myspace.com/jamesyorkston">James Yorkston</a>. Props to Neil for all of those.</p>
<p>The picture is of the sky in Lancashire where I was a couple of weeks ago enjoying some absurdly spring like weather in Febraury.<br /> </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So dear reader, I find myself arriving at a major crossroads in life much sooner than I had anticipated and I don't know which way to go. Let me lay it out for you and if you have any good advice or suggestions, please send it my way....</p>
<p>Just before my exams two weeks ago I went to see my tutor cos I was having trouble with my calculus - no change there - and we got into a conversation about Phd study. The long and the short of it being that he advised me that my current grades were good enough (which was encouraging to hear) and if I wanted to do a Phd I should graduate this summer with a BEng and start my Phd then rather than carry on and do the extra year that would give me a MEng.<br />Yesterday I went to see a potential supervisor who researches in the area of Water Resources and he also suggested the same thing and then explained to me what's involved with doing a Phd: Essentially, having found a novel research topic that is available and a supervisor willing to take me on, I would get three years of funding for a project that is likely to take four years! Most of what happens then is down to me, to do research, teach myself or find ways to get taught what I need to complete the project and any experiments involved. And what happens after that is pretty much unknown at this stage - more research? Get a job?</p>
<p>Financially I'd be better off than I am now (at least for three years), think it works out about £1000 a month tax free and I still get the benefits of being a student re: council tax, discounts etc. Which beats taking on £5000 a year in debt. However that's obviously peanuts compared with a job in the commercial sector.</p>
<p>And the other thing to consider is that I'm free to apply for Phd's wherever I like if I can get them to take me on, so I could go back to London or anywhere else for that matter. I have an advantage in that few British people want to do Phd's, especially in Engineering or Science, so the bar for entry is set a bit lower than it would have been in the past. So that raises a whole other set of questions about where do I want to live? As a city I kind of like Southampton, cos it's so unfashionable and uncool (that's gonna upset someone!) and characterless there's no sense of missing out on anything and instead it's functional and relaxed. Compared with dysfunctional, characterful London with it's cliques and pressures and general sense of self-importance, that's actually quite nice a lot of the time.</p>
<p>What are the alternatives? Finish the MEng and worry about it next year! Finish this year and try and get a job in Civil Engineering. Finish this year and try and get a job in TV. Finish whenever and go and do something completely different.</p>
<p>I've got about a month to make a decision, but to be honest I'm finding it pretty hard to think about sensibly cos I feel like I'm burning out at the moment. I've been putting in a lot of 6 or 7 day weeks since October between work and University. And with the latest bit of Geotechnics coursework, even Ingrid, always the smartest person in the room, has been sending me emails of frustration about how tough it is. And I need to find new tenants for my house in London - if anyone wants to rent a nice house in East London,it's available from March, do let me know...</p>
<p>Life just seems far too complicated and with a definite lack of fun. I
keep having these fantasies selling as much of my stuff as possible so
that I only own a top specification laptop (with back up and internet connection), and some
clothes and perhaps my bicycle. Plus whatever books I'm reading from
the library. Everything else can go, it's all surplus to requirements.</p>
<p>I am sorely tempted to see if I can go back to TV work full time, partly because it'd be nice to not always be worrying about money and partly because it's the only thing I've ever felt genuinely good at. Don't know why I'm good at it or why it makes sense to me, but there's a certain rationality that one should spend ones time doing what one is good at rather than trying to be or do something one is not so good at.</p>
<p>So that's the deal - any ideas anyone?</p>
<p>A quick round up of life since Christmas - work, exams, coursework. I got some money for Christmas, with which I bought some ace Maths software for my computer (yeah, I know) and a <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?pID=10527" target="_blank">device</a> which I attach to my shoe while running that logs my time and distance and then uploads it to my computer. This is one of the best gadgets (talking of surplus to requirements possessions) I've ever had. It is fantastically pedantic and I can now spend hours looking at graphs of my telemetry. If I was richer I could have got the GPS version which logs your route too and plots it on Google Earth and you can annoy all your friends with your runs. Ain't technology grand? Speaking of which, William Gibson posted this <a href="http://gizmodo.com/350091/cheeseburger-in-a-can-is-both-the-best-and-worst-thing-ive-ever-seen%3Cbr%20/%3E" target="_blank">link</a> as a sign of the times we live in. Hard to disagree.</p>
<p>Notable reads of late: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316027871/theidependent-21" target="_blank">Things the Grandchildren Should Know</a> - the Eels front man's memoirs. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0571236456/theidependent-21" target="_blank">Tokyo Year Zero</a> - David Peace's latest about post war Tokyo, which led me to watching Kurosawa's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041699/" target="_blank">Stray Dog </a>which is a tremendous film. Like Kenneth Clarke says, you know Art when you see it and this is it, social commentary and great cinema.</p>
<p>Better go finish my coursework and hand it in. Semester 2 starts on Monday, which means I get a whole day off tomorrow. Hurrah!</p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Well, being someone who is truly averse to making decisions, I can sympathise with your predicament .. but at the risk of sounding complete banal .. try and imagine where you would like to be in 5 years time (and I don't just mean which town) .. make a list of your options, and for each write down all the pros and cons that you can think of. This should help you start creating a division of desirability.
If your fantasy is to sell all your stuff, then I'd say do it (I would consider keeping your motorbike though .. they're fun and more useful over longer distances).. it's good for the soul to have a proper clear out .. and having a "small footprint" is very Zen .. (which ties in nicely with the motorbike .. Zen and the art of.. etc .. The Road Less Travelled is also a good book, about making decisions funnily enough .. I'm sure you've read it)
To my eyes, it sounds like the Phd is calling you .. you said, you'd be financially 'better off' .. so if money is a worry, this would be a step in the right direction.. plus I would imagine you'd get a better paid job in Civil Engineering with a Phd (that's a guess).
As for where to study .. perhaps you should apply to, and visit some places, and see what happens, and what you think .. that decision could be made for you by an Enrollment Administrator, or a particularly unpleasant Friday night out..
I would also like to point out at this juncture, that "a job in television" is what you left to do your course, because you wanted to do something that would benefit others, rather than work in an anti-industry, that parks people's arses, and stiffles freedom and creativity. In the short term however, you can always feelance, and wash yourself thoroughly in the shower afterwards!
here endeth the lesson.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Alex is right man. By the way thanks for the answers to my questions a couple of blogs ago. I regularly take a shower after a freelance gig. Figuratively speaking of course. It is easier now as I can meditate and yogically exorcise myself in India. Bloody hell...... Al.... If I had even the slightest incling of being able to do a PHD I would do it. It gives you status that goes beyond materialism. You will be able to travel all over the bloody world as everyone and his dog in the engineering fraternity will want to here what you have to say especially in the field that you are in.
This is no plug but take a look at my most recent blog entry www.delhidigest.blogspot.com and you will see that you have the opportunity to do what I am craving to do at the moment !! Al ....do the PHD. In the immortal words of Del Boy "You know it makes sense"
Peace and Love

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">Exams season. I sleep worse than usual and I find myself
thinking all sorts of nonsense in during my insomnia and something I often seem to
end up doing is making lists to get through the endless hours. And I started
thinking about books I’ve liked and categorising them so I thought I’d write
some of it down. Most people I meet don’t seem to read much these days, for a
variety of reasons I guess, but I love reading and I love genre fiction. So
here’s a list of author’s and some of their books I’ve particularly liked over
the years from the Science Fiction/Fantasy canon. I was making the list for
myself, but I thought other people might be interested. (I might do a Crime
Fiction list next time.) I made this up
in the middle of the night, so I’ve probably left off loads of books much better
than what I’ve included, so please feel free tell me I’m wrong and offer some
suggestions. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In no particular order:</p>
<p><strong>Cyberpunk</strong>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">William Gibson – <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Neuromancer-William-Gibson/dp/0006480411/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=gateway&amp;qid=1201207663&amp;sr=8-1">Neuromancer</a>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I read this holed up in a hotel room in France when I was 18,
after the guy I was travelling with bailed on me. I’d borrowed his short
stories book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Burning-Chrome-William-Gibson/dp/0006480438/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=gateway&amp;qid=1201212370&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Burning Chrome</a> from the library, but I had to buy this one!
Genre defining and Molly is such a great hero, even if the overall plot is
maybe a bit nebulous.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jim Courtney
Grimwood – <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Arabesk-Trilogy-Jon-Courtenay-Grimwood/dp/0575081325/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=gateway&amp;qid=1201207734&amp;sr=8-1">The
Arabesk Trilogy </a>(3 Novels)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">An alternate history
for the Islamic world set in Northern Africa with more than a touch of cyberpunk. (This is kind of a successor to <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Alec_Effinger">George Alec Effinger</a>,
who explored similar territory a back in the late 80s.) </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jeff Noon – <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Vurt-Jeff-Noon/dp/0330338811/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=gateway&amp;qid=1201207809&amp;sr=8-1">Vurt</a>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_ss_w_h_?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=Vurt&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go">Pollen</a>
and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Falling-Out-Cars-Jeff-Noon/dp/0552999709/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1201207912&amp;sr=1-2">Falling
Out of Cars</a> are brilliant too. Manchester’s own cyberpunk answer to Lewis
Carroll.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Neal Stephenson – <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Snow-Crash-Neal-Stephenson/dp/0140232923/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1201207950&amp;sr=1-1">Snow
Crash</a> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Though maybe <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Diamond-Age-Young-Illustrated-Primer/dp/014027037X/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1201207950&amp;sr=1-1">The
Diamond Age</a> is better, this is a classic cyberpunk novel, funnier than
William Gibson. Great opening sequence about pizza delivery. Still haven’t read
his Baroque Cycle...</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Bruce Sterling – <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Schismatrix-Plus-Selected-Stories-Crystal/dp/0441003702/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1201208024&amp;sr=1-1">Schismatrix</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another classic, but
this time imaging a post-earth future for humans. Incredible imagination.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Pat Cadigan – <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tea-Empty-Cup-Pat-Cadigan/dp/0586218424/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1201208055&amp;sr=1-2">Tea
from an empty cup</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of the few women
cyberpunk writers, but one of the best. She’s one of those authors like
Maupassant or Camus that really knows the art of the ‘mot juste’. To quote
Wikipedia, ‘Her novels and stories all share a common theme, exploring
the relationship between the human mind and technology.’</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Richard Morgan – <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Altered-Carbon-Gollancz-Richard-Morgan/dp/0575081120/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1201208112&amp;sr=1-2">Altered
Carbon</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Kind of taken on the cyberpunk mantle into the 21<sup>st</sup>
century mixing it with noir crime fiction (and Poe) and a bit of the politics
of war to produce this cracker.</p>
<p><strong>English Fantasy</strong>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Alan Garner – <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Shift-Collins-Voyager-Alan-Garner/dp/0007127863/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1201208198&amp;sr=1-2">Red
Shift</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A work of heart breaking genius as the cliché goes, but this
short tale of growing up the hard way set in multiple time periods in the same
location near Manchester is exactly that. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Alan Moore – <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Voice-Fire-Alan-Moore/dp/1891830449/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1201208234&amp;sr=1-1">Voice
of the Fire</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">His only novel to
date. Tread’s similar ground to Alan Garner mixing history and location,
here around Northampton, but so clever and moving. Takes a while to get into
though.</p>
<p><strong>Other Stuff I don’t have a catergory for</strong>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jack Womack – <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Random-Acts-Senseless-Violence-Womack/dp/0586213201/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;s=gateway&amp;qid=1201207378&amp;sr=8-5">Random
Acts of Senseless Violence</a> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of my all time favourite authors, but not necessarily
easy to track down. This is a kind of Anne Frank’s diary for the future. One
thing that I think makes him so good is his ability to create new language from
present use and combine this with present social concerns and extrapolate them
to their logical extremes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick">Philip
K. Dick</a> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I can’t choose a book by this guy. I think whoever ordered
books for my local library was a fan, as from the age of 14 to 16 I consumed
novel after novel by him and there was always more.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Walter Tevis – <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mockingbird-S-F-Masterworks-S-Walter-Tevis/dp/0575079150/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1201208348&amp;sr=1-10">Mockingbird</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">From the author of ‘The Hustler’ a beautiful book about the
power and joy of language after the human race has driven itself nearly to
extinction because of an obsession with individuality and abdication of
responsibility.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Walter M. Miller Jr – <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Canticle-Leibowitz-Bantam-Spectra-Book/dp/0553273817/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1201208385&amp;sr=1-1">A
Canticle for Liebowitz</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As good a book
damming the human race for being stupid as you’re likely to read ;-) </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Margeret Atwood – <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Oryx-Crake-Margaret-Atwood/dp/1844080285/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1201208420&amp;sr=1-1">Oryx
and Crake</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Almost as good as A
Canticle for Liebowitz! And of course <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Handmaids-Tale-Contemporary-Classics/dp/0099740915/ref=pd_sim_b?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1201208420&amp;sr=1-1">A
Handmaid’s Tale</a> is outstanding too.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ursula Le Guin – <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dispossessed-Gollancz-S-F-Ursula-Guin/dp/0575079037/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1201208998&amp;sr=1-11">The
Dispossessed</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I’ve written about
this before, so ‘nuff said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Tim Powers – <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Anubis-Gates-Fantasy-Masterworks/dp/0575077255/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1201208487&amp;sr=1-1">The
Anubis Gate</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Last-Call-Tim-Powers/dp/0380715570/ref=pd_sim_b?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1201208487&amp;sr=1-1">Last
Call</a> is brilliant too. One of those authors who likes to take real
historical figures and weave magic around them blending mythologies together.
The Anubis Gate mixes up time travel with myths of Punch and Judy with
Egyptology in Victorian England. Last Call is all about the Fisher King Legends
and Tarot in Las Vegas. And Pirates of the Caribbean must have been influenced
by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Stranger-Tides-Tim-Powers/dp/1930235321/ref=pd_sim_b?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1201208487&amp;sr=1-1">On
Stranger Tides</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Michael Marshall
Smith – <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/One-Us-Michael-Marshall-Smith/dp/000649997X/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1201208725&amp;sr=1-3">One
of Us</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Only-Forward-Michael-Marshall-Smith/dp/0006512666/ref=pd_sim_b?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1201208725&amp;sr=1-3">Only
Forwards</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Spares-Michael-Marshall-Smith/dp/0006512674/ref=pd_sim_b?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1201208725&amp;sr=1-3">Spares</a>
are great too. Before he went onto to write rubbish crime/horror novels he
wrote these three great books about dreams, technology and love.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Neal Asher – <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Skinner-Neal-Asher/dp/0330484346/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1201208823&amp;sr=1-12">The
Skinner</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Bit of a guilty
pleasure like watching Top Gear. Like Clarkson I can never decide if he’s
actually as right wing as he’s makes out or just messing with us. It’s so
violent and yet entertaining to read his writing has earned the sub-genre title
of Splatterpunk.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Robert A. Heinlein –
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Starship-Troopers-Robert-Heinlein/dp/0340837934/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1201208857&amp;sr=1-1">Starship
Troopers</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Speaking of people
with a reputation as right wing! I read this as description of what happens
when societies go to war and people end up believing crazy fascist things
because of the extreme experiences they have and the need to make things black and
white, but its reputation is that this is literally what the author thought was
true. Joe Haldeman’s The Forever War gives the other side of this coin.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Douglas Adams – <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hitchhikers-Guide-Galaxy-Douglas-Adams/dp/0330258648/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1201208904&amp;sr=1-2">Hitchhikers
Guide</a>...</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I think a lot of
people are put off by the mixing of humour and s.f., but it’s one of those
books that just sticks with you and the observations seems to get more and more
accurate as time goes by.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Christopher Moore – <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dirty-Job-Christopher-Moore/dp/1841496030/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1201208937&amp;sr=1-1">A
Dirty Job</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is a tale of
death and of life as a beta male single parent in San Francisco He’s the king of the foul
mouthed one liner and while he’s maybe not so good at the mixing of narrative
with social observation as Douglas Adams, he’s very very good. For example the
simile that ‘it was a mixed blessing, like herpes on the popes’ ring’ works on
so many levels. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Eight weeks worth of stuff here, so it’s quite long!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Starting with a positive for a change, the course is much
better this year than the previous two. Which with hindsight feel like the equivalent
of Army Basic Training; beasting us to get us to a point of mental fitness
where we can do something more interesting than just proving we can jump that
high.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is not to say it isn’t really intense and the level of
the work has increased significantly again. It is different to doing TV work, which
is intense in different ways, but the time spent is probably in excess of what I
would do in a working week there and it’s not something I can easily leave on
campus at the end of the day. Lectures have been cut to about 50% of what they
were in previous years. This may seem like less value for money! But it means
that the supervisors become a resource and we learn by doing, rather than
spending all day listening and then studying at night or on the weekends.
Stopping studying at 7pm and maybe having a whole day on the weekend with no
studying at all feels like a luxury.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Here’s what I’ve been doing this term:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Geotechnical Engineering. By far the hardest subject as it
is so complicated. We had a class test in November and I ended up with 17 pages
of calculations for this one problem. Then we had the coursework to design a
retaining wall on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link that the school has been
involved with designing and monitoring. It took me one month, yielding 28 Pages of
calculations, 5 spreadsheets and learning a new computer program (and making a
lot of assumptions) to come up with a design for that.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To give some context, because a wall is not an exciting
thing and it’s hard to imagine why anyone would choose to spend their time designing them: There are many cases of natural and human structures that have failed and
killed people, a famous example of the failure of a human made structure being
the collapse of a slag heap at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.south-wales.police.uk/fe/master.asp?n1=8&amp;n2=253&amp;n3=492">Aberfan</a>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This collapse could have been prevented if the theory of how
such heaps of materials behave had been better understood. The equation that
describes the mechanism of collapse is actually very simple, but it wasn’t
known then and hence no one knew about the risk. (We’ve also considered the
collapse of the Levee’s in New Orleans in earlier lectures.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now imagine the consequences of a failing wall on a track
designed for trains running in excess of 150 mph and perhaps the significance
of good design for something as mundane as a wall is more obvious. Something to
think about next time you’re on the Tube, a train or driving through a cutting.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hydrology as I’ve probably mentioned before is the subject I
find most interesting. This subject (perhaps familiar to anyone with Geography GCSE or equivalent)
deals with <a target="_blank" href="http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/watercyclesummary.html">the water cycle</a> from an engineering point of view. By this I mean
considering water resource management and the topics this entails such as providing
potable water to everyone, flood prediction and the effects of climate change. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My coursework for this module is to design a water supply
system for a (hypothetical) village in Tunisia. This is a challenge that
involves estimating the water requirements for a population for their personal
use and for agriculture and then designing a delivery system for this water in
a way that actually works and is sustainable for decades to come. I’m at an early
stage with this coursework, but for part of it I will be using software
designed and produced in part by my lecturer for the United Nations and which is
used for crop irrigation studies worldwide. It’s freely available to anyone and
you can read about it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fao.org/nr/water/infores_databases_cropwat.html">here</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A lot of this module has been focused on understanding the
water cycle for Southampton and the South East of England and the climate
change stuff is quite worrying when one looks into it. I expect for most of us
living in this part of the world (and probably everywhere else too) things are
going to have change significantly in order to adjust to these changes, not
least in the way we use fresh water in the next twenty years. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My Vortex Induced Vibrations project is the other main use
of my time. It took the best part of a month to work through the theory and carry
out all the calculations necessary to start building the experiment. Now the
challenge is to try and build it and I’m running into all the practical issues
of actually trying to construct something that has a chance of testing the
theory and thus making the experiment worthwhile. The days I’ve spent in the
Lab so far have been really frustrating, trying stuff and finding it doesn’t work
and then having to think of something else, finding that doesn’t work and so
on. This is the difference between being able to look up something in a book
and doing something for which there is no manual! In itself, this is a very
instructive process, but I’m definitely on the wrong side of the hill at the
moment.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The point of this project is to try and understand the
effects of how a structure (in this case a long thin cylinder) is fixed (in
this case with restraints that can move about) have on the way it vibrates when fluid
flows over it. This is significant for marine structures such as the tubes that
bring oil up from the sea floor, but it is also of interest just as a part of fluid
dynamics theory that is still not well understood. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Lastly, there is my least favourite subject: Structures. I
still don’t really have a feel for how forces in structures behave, so I find
this a tough subject that I mostly learn by rote rather than actually
understand. I’ve been spending yet more time learning about reinforced concrete
beams and columns! But if one wants to build <a target="_blank" href="http://www.arcspace.com/architects/alsop/sharp_center/sharp_center.html">strange
structures</a> out of this stuff (I don’t), I guess one better understand it.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This subject is also linked with Finite Element Analysis,
which a very clever if rather mind bending mathematical technique, particularly
suited to computers, for solving problems that could not be solved
analytically. Attempting plain English, I mean that some problems such finding
the area of a circle can be solved in a way that produces an equation that symbolically
describe the solution; in this case the familiar Pi-r-squared equation.
Numerical Solutions are always approximations (such as Pi is equal to 3.142),
albeit very good ones, so good in fact that computers are used to design pretty
much everything we actually use in everyday life.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As the name suggests, Finite Element Analysis breaks (for
example) a structure down into small approximate parts that can be analysed individually
and then put together to produce an overall solution or set of solutions to
different scenarios. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It’s a very powerful method, but one that is the complete opposite
of intuitive to learn and that’s what makes it difficult (well, for me anyway.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I find it difficult to describe what it means to try to learn to think like an
engineer&nbsp; – they have such a bad and often well deserved reputation
for poor social skills and general geekery – that the stereotype gets in the
way of the positive aspects that should in my opinion be seen as something to
aspire to. The best engineers I’ve met combine the ability to think freely – by
which I mean they have a whole library of experiences, theories and critical
thinking skills that can cut through their or others prejudices -&nbsp; with the ability to communicate effectively to
whoever their audience/collaborators are in order to actually solve a problem. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So that’s my course and other than the usual bit of reading,
watching films, listening to music, running and swimming, that is my life.
Notable films I’ve watched <a target="_blank" href="http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/michaelclayton">Michael Clayton</a>,
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/livesofothers?q=the%20lives%20of%20others">The
Lives of Others</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/volver?q=volver">Volver</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/houseofmirth?q=house%20of%20mirth">The
House of Mirth</a>. Notable books – None! But I have some lined up for reading
over the vacation. New music I’ve liked is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/burial/untrue">Burial</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scoutniblett.com/">Scout Niblett</a> (props to Ms. Grayson) and
the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/lcdsoundsystem/4533">LCD
Soundsystem Mini-Album</a>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Finally, it wouldn’t be December if I wasn’t obsessed with
the light – I think maybe it’s something to do with it being in such short supply
- as well as the angle at which it hits this part of the world at this time of
year that makes it seem so special to me. So here’s a picture from a particularly
colourful December dawn at the top.</p>

I am particularly interested in one aspect of what you do and how it must be linked with financials ?? For example.... the research you have been doing with regards to the re-inforcing of the channel tunnel walls.... Presumeably the powers that be who would authorise the money to actually action this kind of work would also be thinking about future value to be gained... possible impacts on the life of the tunnel and therefore how much actual profit can be forecast in the years to come, share pricing etc etc. Is that something that you would have to possibly get invovled with in the future ??? Does that mean one you have finished this degree you will have to then go off and do an MBA or something :))) By the way .... how many years should the channel tunnel last.
Hope you are well otherwise Alistair and keep up the good work. I am absolutely convinced now that I have read the above that I am not capable of doing what you do. In fact I only understood a couple of words.. like .... ""and"" and ""the""... hehehe.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Sanjiv,
Yes the financial aspect is very much part of the course, though not one I've really written about. We do management modules dealing with the organisational aspects of running a project so as to minimise costs and waste as well as teaching us about the laws involved with these things.
And certainly after safety, producing an economical design is probably the biggest consideration. In the case of the Channel Tunnel Wall they actually lost faith in the design and took a decision to lengthen the wall depth by two metres more than what the calculations estimated to ensure its’ safety. For a wall several kilometres long this extra depth would have come at considerable expense and therefore cut into any profits the design company would hope to make on such a project. This is also why the wall is part of a monitoring project, so that seeing what happens in reality can help refine the models and give designers confidence in producing the most economic (as well as safe) designs for future projects. This is true for all engineering.
It’s also important in terms of sustainability and general ethical considerations that engineers can produce designs that are safe and have minimal impact on the environment and people within it and so producing an optimum design is important for lots of reasons – but certainly, most engineering even in the public sector is done by private companies who are obviously looking to make a profit. Personally I see the challenge as to line up everyone’s self interest in the same direction as in the past the interest of the engineering companies and the population and the environment have been very much in conflict. Whether this is always possible remains open to discussion, but good use of contracts and regulation to guide people is certainly possible in many cases if people can get out of the short term quick profit mentality that has been the human way for the last 150 years when we thought our resources were infinite.
In answer to your other question, generally design life is for 120 years, but as was mentioned in another lecture it’s unrealistic to imagine swapping out all our infrastructure every 120 years! Can you imagine replacing every road, wall, building, drainage system etc.?! It’s not only impossible in terms of cost and inconvenience, but in terms of materials. So in reality, just as we convert Victorian Houses for 21st Century living, our infrastructure gets serviced for modern use, such as St. Pancras Station has recently and only completely replaced as a last resort.
Hope that answers your questions.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was a few bits and pieces I didn't write about last time that I thought I'd add.</p>
<p>One was my current track listing. As most people probably know I love making mixes and I have a list which I change all the time with 'Things I'm liking now' on it. As I travel to London often for work on the weekend, this is what I listen to on my journey. So as of the end of the week 19th October this is my current playlist for anyone who wants to check out any of the tracks. (Ignore the Genre, rating etc. columns, Media Monkey just generates this nonsense and I couldn't be bothered to edit the HTML):</p>

Rip it up and start again is my kind of theme tune for the moment as it seems to be where I end up whenever I try to do any studying. If anyone wants me to send them a copy of this mix, let me know.</p>
<p>I finished the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0575079037/theidependent-21" target="_blank">The Dispossessed</a> and it got me having a bit of a rant in my own head about science fiction. It is a really moving book about personal freedom and anarchism and is at least as good as any straight fiction I've read dealing with similar issues. Most people's experience of science fiction seems to be Star Wars or Star Trek which are pretty much cowboy films set in space and not really an important part of the genre in my opinion. One important function of SF really is to explore and extrapolate issues affecting people now and this can be done much more effectively if the context of the real day to day world is taken out of the picture. So one can get hung up on the fact William Gibson didn't think of mobile phones in Neuromancer or the stupid names characters always have - or one can accept the imperfections in predicting the future and experience the chance to think different in a fantasy world (as Apple would purport to have us do).</p>
<p>So as I say the Dispossessed is all about an anarchist society and the role of an individual within it. It's very hard to imagine what anarchy would really mean from our everyday experience and so it needs the construction of a fantasy to allow this to be played out and explored. It's extraordinary for something that was written in 1974 to seem so new and most people on the planet I think would still find the ideas it contains a threat and ridiculous even now. But ironically it's also not hard to see how they could connect to the problems of and solutions for global warming, overpopulation, fighting over scarce resources and the rise of dogma that threaten to wipe humanity off the planet in the next 150 years.</p>
<p>Likewise I'm watching series three of the new version of Battlestar Galactica and I find it extraordinary that such a mainstream (and occasionally clunky and cheesy) series is dealing with genocide, internment, suicide bombings and summary executions in such an explicit fashion. Because it's in a fantasy world they can explore things that would just not be acceptable in a drama if replaced with times, locations and people familiar to us in the here and now. It manages to be exciting, silly and thought provoking in one shot. And it's far superior to something like Heroes or Lost in my opinion which are all gloss and have nothing to say that I can see.</p>
<p>I'm not writing this to say it's better than other fiction, just that it is as good and deserves the recognition and to be consumed as widely as other stuff. It serves a purpose political and ideological and just plain imaginative that is as worthy as any classic form of narrative. So I'm glad Doris Lessing got her award and I'd like to see more people taking a chance on this stuff and exploring all the sub genres too.</p>
<p>The only other thing on my mind was to lay out where I'm at and what I'm actually doing this year. I'm starting year three of my degree and year four of my studying at Southampton. I potentially graduate in summer 2009. This semester I have four modules to study:</p>
<p>Structures and Geotechnical Engineering (aka Soil Mechnics) are the two core modules for Civil Engineering. They're the ones I have most trouble with, really hard and quite dull. As we get further into the course these get further from complete theoretical models and more towards a mix of theoretical approximation and empirical experience. In engineering and science approximation has a subtly different meaning to its everyday use. This is because there is always uncertainty in real life and for engineers it's about what are acceptable levels of uncertainty and/or approximation. The usual example being that one will quote ones height to the nearest centimetre or inch as knowing to the nearest atom is either impossible or unnecessary.</p>
<p>These two subjects then are about understanding and predicting what will happen to structures build on or in the ground so as to make them safe for people to use. It's not something I really have any strong interest in, but the methods and the maths have a lot of correlations with things that do interest me.</p>
<p>Thirdly is Hydrology, which is much more interesting to me and is all about Water Resource engineering. How we work out how much water there is, where it is, predicting future behaviour and engineering accordingly. It's quite a scary subject in terms of making one feel pessimistic about the future of humanity when facts like it takes 10,000 kilos of water to produce 1 kg of Basmati Rice are banded about. Or it takes about a minimum of 25 kg of fresh water a day to sustain a human being - ever considered having to carry that weight about? Millions of people do that every day to survive, while we use 7 kg of drinkable water every time we flush the toilet. Crazy world.</p>
<p>Lastly there's my individual project which is all about hydrodynamics - water movement over a circular cylindrical tube creating vortex induced vibration - in plain english. An effect most famous for causing the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxTZ446tbzE">Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse</a>. Which sounds quite dull, but is pretty challenging in terms of the maths and physics and is an area of research that has been going on for years but is still not well understood. I have to design and carry out an experiment and it's quite daunting at this point in proceedings.</p>
<p>I'm not sure there's much to be gained by expressing my feelings about my studies (or what I'm doing in general) cos it makes me feel miserable if I dwell on it. Just got to get on with it.<br /> </p>

<p>Following some good advice that I counter my rising anxiety about get back to studying by doing some drawing, I've indulged myself by drawing some of my favourite current student stereotypes that I see every day. At the risk of offending some of my readers, I thought I'd publish the results here, please click on them to see them bigger.They are affectionate. Honest!</p>
<p>From left to right then we have:</p>
<p>1. The Emo Kids, easily recognisable by having a long fringe over one eye, skinny black jeans with a studded belt, converse style trainers and some kind of skinny band/skate T-shirt (though some of them only wear long sleeves, presumably to cover up their self-harming). Both sexes tend to dress the same, generally quite androgynous, the boys often favour some kind of chunky /nerdy glasses too. They are <em>so </em>cool and well groomed.</p>
<p>2. My favourite group, partly cos of my own dodgy fashion history and partly cos of the shear effort required to maintain the look, are the Cassock-Wearing Goths. They always fill my heart with joy when I see them, especially if it's raining and their hair has gone all lank and their clothes are starting to smell like wet lunchtimes at school (slightly like wee). Black is the default setting, nail varnish and eye-liner included and generally a lot of buckles and piercings going on. Must be a nightmare at Airport security. Sometimes they sneak a bit of purple into their outfits too and of course no tans allowed.</p>
<p>3. The next group are what I can only describe as inappropriate flip flop wearers - boys and girls. Whatever time of year and whatever the weather there's always loads of people wearing flip flops and board shorts. If it's really cold sometimes they'll put on a hoody. It's like the young persons equivalent of a nice pair of slacks and slippers. Awful clashing colours and patterns, but ask them what the hell they're doing wearing flip flops in February and they'll tell you it's cos it's so comfy and they only have to walk a few hundred yards from their bed to the nice warm lecture theatre and they can sleep in their shorts. Sloth thy name is student.</p>
<p>4.Last but by no means least&nbsp; are the Posh Girls: Expensive hair, Ug Boots, Tight blue jeans with a huge belt, Hoody with a slogan of whichever department/society they're part of on the back e.g. 'Geographers do it in the field' and a top of the line Mobile Phone (how long til I see my first Iphone on campus?) on which they're usually texting or speaking in a loud horsey voice to one of their friends. Walking evidence of how white and middle class Southampton University is. (We do have a fair amount of foreign students and British students from ethnic minorities, but it is very much a minority in percentage terms.) Still, the Posh Girls are so entertaining in terms of voyeurism, I can't dislike them. They wear big bug-eyed shades when the sun is out too.&nbsp; I'm <em>so</em> like, <em>yeah</em>, whatever...</p>
<p>Continuing the student theme, I've had a couple of conversations about money recently and I thought I'd work out what it costs me to be a student and how much I actually have to live on. I was quite surprised with what I calculated. This is not me whining by the way, I could change my lifestyle and cut my costs substantially - by living in a student house for example. I just thought it might be interesting to some people to see what it's like these days.</p>
<p>My net monthly income after taxes, expenses, rent and bills over the
summer has been approx. £352 a month, £100 of which goes into savings,
leaving me £252&nbsp; a month to spend on food, clothes and anything else
such as going out. In other words if I estimate £30 for food &amp; household
goods each week, I have about £27 a week disposable income. Which
actually is not too bad, all things considered (£8 goes on swimming fees each week)...I won't be getting a
yacht any time soon though!
<br />
<br />(I didn't factor in other one-off costs such as MOT, Road Tax and
re-insuring my bike that I've had to pay out too, so this may even be a
bit of an overestimate.)
<br />
<br />And for each year of study I incur just under £5,000 in debt in student
loans.
<br />
<br />So I make it that I need to receive about £10 worth of learning every
day I am at University to get good value from being here! Not sure how I
measure that though, unless I can accurately predict my future
earnings...</p>
<p>Term starts properly on Monday, so I doubt I'll post again until Christmas unless I really feel in need of a rant. I've just finished a 10,000 word report that I have to hand in for one of this years modules already, so I'm expecting a massive workload again.</p>
<p>I did find time to sneak in a couple more novels before I go back:</p>
<p> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0747562598/theidependent-21">Oryx &amp; Crake by Margaret Atwood</a> which is just excellent. This and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099464985/theidependent-21">Power of the Dog</a> are the two best novels I've read this year so far. O&amp;C is Post-Apocalyptic stuff. It's a long time since I read a novel in 24 hours but I really couldn't stop with this one.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316730122/theidependent-21">Attack of the Unsinkable Rubber Ducks by Christopher Brookmyre</a> : Not one of his best, but still pretty good. If you've ever wonder how psychics do their tricks, some of it's revealed in here and he's still quite funny.</p>
<p>And I've just started <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0575079037/theidependent-21">The Dispossessed by Ursula Le Guin </a>which is supposed to be something of a feminist SF classic that I've been meaning to read for some time. Pretty good so far</p>

-------
Well Jen, you are very cool and well groomed so I'm sure your new fringe is perfect.
I've only read two of the stories in Magic For Beginners so far. I can only really compare them to a more humorous version of Jorge Luis Borges. Really beautiful prose and bonkers stories, yet troubling and moving. The first one is about a handbag made out of a live dog in which the people from under the hill live! Which makes about as much sense as it sounds! See for the handover on Saturday night...A

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/29/sand_face.jpg"><img width="100" height="122" border="0" alt="Sand_face" title="Sand_face" src="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/images/2007/08/29/sand_face.jpg" /></a>
</p>
<p>I'd kind of given up writing for a while, for various reasons and this is going to be more of a list of stuff than any diary/commentary kind of entry (you'll probably be glad to know).</p>
<p>Since I last wrote I finished out the academic year with another set of exams and stack of coursework including a three month long group project that generated over 66,000 words of reports on it's own. Much to my surprise I passed my exams which was a big relief, but has the irony of meaning I've no justification for quitting. To I do that I'll have to find another reason - fortunately spurious justifications are a staple of humanity.</p>
<p>Summer's been about as gloomy as me and I noted one week that seven days had passed without more communication than it takes to purchase milk from the Co-op, but on the plus side it's given me the chance to read books that aren't textbooks. So here's a record of what I've been reading so far:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099464985/theidependent-21" target="_blank">Power of the Dog</a><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099464985/theidependent-21">&nbsp;</a>by Don Winslow - Excellent fictionalised account of the drugs trade in Mexico</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1841493791/theidependent-21" target="_blank">Command Decision </a>by Elizabeth Moon - Latest instalment in this space opera about a family of women.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0434017078/theidependent-21" target="_blank">Winter of Frankie Machine</a> by Don Winslow - Like a really good episode of the Sopranos.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0575075139/theidependent-21" target="_blank">Black Man</a> by Richard Morgan - A bit disappointed by this. Dense and not very exciting, but with some really good bits.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0007209975/theidependent-21" target="_blank">The Intruders</a> by Michael Marshall - Don't bother. Boring horror. Read his first three novels as Micheal Marshall Smith instead</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1841496030/theidependent-21" target="_blank">A Dirty Job</a> by Christopher Moore - A highly amusing book about Death. He's a king of the one-liner. Must read some more of his.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099506920/theidependent-21">A Spot of Bother</a> by Mark Haddon - By the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Curious-Incident-Dog-Night-time-Adult/dp/0099450259/ref=sr_1_1/026-2224771-8982866?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1188396017&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Curious Incident of the Dog</a>... guy. Not sure if I liked this or not, sometimes funny, sometimes quite depressing and what was it trying to say if anything? I dunno.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0575080507/theidependent-21" target="_blank">Brasyl</a> by Ian Macdonald - been one of my favourite writers for years this guy. Extraordinary imagination he has. He generally makes my head hurt a bit and this is no exception.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670914940/theidependent-21" target="_blank">Spook Country</a> by William Gibson - He has a special way with prose, so that even if the story is not remarkable, the way it's written definitely is.</p>
<p>And from the non-fiction section:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0006530400/theidependent-21" target="_blank">No Logo by Naomi Klein</a> - been meaning to read this for years and should be finished in time for her new one. It's really raised my consciousness another notch about globalisation. She's a really good writer too in laying out the complexities involved and even if some bits seem a bit out of date, the first two sections No Space and No Choice are brilliant. And I hadn't realised how much of a feminist issue this stuff is too. It's also made me reflect on how this aspect of human rights is less in the public eye in these days of global warming and wars on terror yet is surely related to both issues.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400077427/theidependent-21" target="_blank">Stumbling on Happiness by Daniel Gilbert</a> - Completely misleading title and cover to this book. Covers similar ground to <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1905177070/theidependent-21" target="_blank">Irrationality</a> in laying out ways in which intuition fails.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0618242953/theidependent-21" target="_blank">The Canon by Natalie Angier</a> - A really excellent popular science book outlining the key findings of science. Written to partly bridge the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Cultures" target="_blank">C.P. Snow Two Cultures</a> gap, her passion that everyone should enjoy science as much as they do the produce of art really comes across. I'll definitely read her prize winning book on female physiology <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Woman-Intimate-Geography-Natalie-Angier/dp/1860496849/ref=pd_bowtega_1/026-2224771-8982866?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1188392702&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Woman</a> when I'm done with this one.</p>
<p>And I'm just starting <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1847671179/theidependent-21" target="_blank">The End of Mr. Y</a> by Scarlett Thomas and have a book of short stories <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/000724200X/theidependent-21" target="_blank">Magic for Beginners</a> by Kelly Link (which are crazy Borges style stories) on the go too. Plus a couple on the side I've yet to start.<br /> </p>
<p>I've got a new project on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_Induced_Vibration" target="_blank">Vortices's</a> to start working on prior to the new semester in a month and have write a report on my TV work. So I'm learning a new Matrix Maths program <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/" target="_blank">MATLAB</a> and have to try and design an experiment to go in the wind tunnel here which is going to be quite a challenge. </p>
<p>The picture above is a face I helped to make on the beach at Littlehampton last week. I went to the <a href="http://www.pallant.org.uk/" target="_blank">Pallant House Gallery</a> nearby at Chichester too which was really good if you're in the area. Made me want to learn more about Paul Klee. I also went to see the <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/heliooiticica/default.shtm" target="_blank">Helio Oticicia</a> exhibition at the Tate Modern when I was in London.It is still on until 23rd September if it appeals. That kind of appealed to me in it's math-rock way with it's use of geometry and light. It also kind of reminded me Edward Hopper because of the light aspects to the work.</p>
<p>With the exception of the William Gibson, Richard Morgan and Natalie Angier books, all of the above books came from the library, so save your money if you like the look of one or more of them.</p>
<p>I've listened to loads of new music too (see sidebar for more). My favourite albums so far this year are the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sound-Silver-LCD-Soundsystem/dp/B000M3452Y/ref=sr_1_1/026-2224771-8982866?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1188394892&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">LCD Soundsystem</a> one (Thank you Steve) and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ma-Fleur-Cinematic-Orchestra/dp/B000KB6D9Q/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/026-2224771-8982866?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1188398830&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">The Cinematic Orchestra</a> one (Thank you Neil).</p>
<p>Too many links!</p>

<p>This post has been rolling on since February and I just don't like what I read each time I finish typing. Still, my reality feels a bit altered at the moment so maybe I'll just post it anyway. I spent the afternoon watching the latest David Lynch film - Inland Empire. Three hours of Low Res Digital Video Surrealism. No one makes films quite like him. I've no real idea what it's all about. It'll probably make more sense when it's worked it's way around my subconscious for a few days. And I'm sure to be having nightmares about Laura Derns face for weeks to come. If he ever makes a straight up horror film I think I'd be too scared to watch it, this was disturbing enough. He is a master of the intense soundtrack effects and making it so murky one is straining to see what is lurking in the gloom while petrified at what freaky image it might turn out to be. And when I came out the whole world seems like a bit of dreamscape. Quite an imagination and well worth checking out if you can find it on anywhere. </p>
<p>Seeing Inland Empire is as close as I've had to a holiday since Christmas too, in the never ending rounds of assessment that is a Civil Engineering Degree. It's a world away from equations and rules and regulations. My next batch of exams is in three weeks and they're real tough ones too. A proper step up in difficulty from what I've done before and the real possibility of failure. I've been on the edge of quitting several times in the last few weeks because I'm not sure I'll ever be able to perform well academically, especially in exams. And I'm starting to think after all these years that actually teamwork isn't for me. I think I've been encouraged to believe it's good for me to work with other people, but it just pisses me off so much sometimes having to deal with their crap. Makes me miserable. <br />The other thing that has really started to bug me is how everything is about getting over hurdles, acheiving a pass mark or getting accredited in this that or the other rather than focusing on the thing itself - the subject matter. Now I'm pretty much an empiricist and measuring and quantifying things is great when I'm trying to understand a problem, but it seems like the tail is wagging the dog these days in Education (and everywhere else). It feels like Standards, League Tables, Accreditations etc. are everywhere and that more time and effort is put into passing the measurement process than into the thing it is supposedly assessing. Things can becomes a game of manipulation to reach the standard and render the whole thing largely meaningless and a waste of time as an accurate indicator of quality. It's irrational in that it defeats what it has set out to achieve. I'm assuming that things are this way is partly because of the competition for funds, jobs etc. combined with the psychological effect of sticking a simple number on something so it can be ranked and clear choices made accordingly - everything has a star rating these days. It got five stars in the Guardian? It must be a good film mustn't it? <br />As everyone knows, passing a driving test does not make one a good driver, it just indicates that a set of standards have been met that enable one to pass that particular test. I'm not saying do away with exams or assessments, obviously the driving test serves a purpose, but I wonder how useful a measure a lot of these things are and that they may often interfere with the process of improving standards rather than actually raising them. <br />It was really refreshing when we got to the end of our Hydraulics module and the lecturer said, 'Today I'm going to teach you about some stuff just because I think you might find it interesting. We could do revision instead and this will not help you pass any tests, but I thought we should go back to how University education used to be for a change.' <br />I have a similar issue with my attitude to the sports I do - other sports people often seem bemused that I'm more interested in the feeling of doing the sport and not overly fussed about achieving a particular time or competing for a place - where as I can understand their interest in the standard arbitrary measure of betterness i.e. time or ranking - I do often take my time, it is a useful measure - they don't seem to be able to understand my existential approach to sport!</p>
<p>Maybe I've been watching too many zombie films, but I've been thinking a lot about death over the last few weeks. Especially when it's 3 am and I can't sleep and I ask myself how many more sleepless 3ams do I have left? And I found myself going over when I first became aware of the finite nature of life and who I've known who is now dead and how they died and did it mean anything anyway, given that it comes to us all and eventually the universe will expire and no-one will be left to feel bad about anything. I'm much more scared about having to cope with the death's of others than I am of being dead myself. <br />Zombie films aid this line of thinking because in the zombie format the protagonists are relentlessly battling creatures that are trying to kill them and there's usually no escape or victory at the end so it's essentially a futile task. If you get killed, you become one of them and it's really just a matter of time before you do. So at 3am this is, as an analogy, perfect for filling my head with dread about the coming day and life in general.<br />I decided that the first real awareness I had of the arbitrary nature of it all was when I was eleven and Mark Tildesley, a couple of years below me at primary school was abducted (and I found out subsequently, murdered.) Everyone at school appeared on Crimewatch, it's really weird looking back, this strange kind of excitement around the whole thing followed by life just carrying on as usual for me. He'd be 31 now.<br />At secondary school, I remember joking about the statistical nature of how as a group we'd be picked off throughout life and I think it was about two or three months after I left school when I was 16 that Thomas Seward got knocked off his bike and killed. We weren't close friends, but we'd been in all the same classes for five years and it was shocking to think that was where his existence ended. Just like that.<br />It was my grandmother dieing that probably hurt me the most. That was when I was still a teenager and was when I fully realised that some things just do not make sense. No amount of thinking works. I remember being at the funeral and crouching between some cars and a wall trying to hide while I was crying my eyes out because I felt embarrassed about it.<br />When I was 27, Glen who I had been living with for six months before he left, killed himself not long after leaving (although the coroner was unsure whether the heroin overdose was deliberate or accidental). That one made me feel somewhere between angry and jealous. Again we weren't really close, but when I see someone every day for six months, I felt I knew him well enough and it just felt really unfair. Cos that's the rub for me. Once you're dead you have no problems anymore, it's when you're alive you've got troubles. He got out, I'm still here. It's very confusing.<br />When I watch the news I often have to remind myself that the dead person or people that are shown as numbers or individual hate figures or whoever they are on TV, must have meant something to someone. And yet it seems bizarre to contemplate all those who have gone before me and whose DNA has led to mine over millennia in an emotional way, let alone the billions of years still to run ahead where everyone I've ever known will be gone and surely forgotten. (Though I find doubtful that humans will still be around for more than a couple of hundred more years.)<br />I've come to no great conclusions about any of this. It doesn't make me prize life more greatly or have greater fears about death, though I do fear grief. It's too difficult and probably unhealthy to maintain the emotional pitch that occurs around thoughts of mortality of those close to us. I'm still taken aback by how arbitrary it all is though. </p>

Why doesn't it make you prize life more??? We have all been through the same feelings, have had similar trials and tribulations in life ( although not able to write them as eloquently as you :) Of course you should enjoy it to the max man !!! That is what I try and do everyday of my life. I'm not talking about jumping out of planes and doing extreme stuff like that. I am talking about simple things like really relishing going out with an old friend or watching my kids play together and really cherishing the sights and sounds of their laughter. I suppose it is a state of mind. Hey ..... I moved continents in search of a better way of life and living. It was the best thing I have ever done :))
Best of luck in your exams. You must keep your chin up. You made the decision so the least you can do for yourself is to go in fighting for every mark :))
Warm........ Warmest regards
Sanjiv

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Blimey ..
That's quite the black mood you managed to capture there .. Well the clocks have changed now, so think about the summer sun that's coming to cheer you the f*** up.
This post is pretty dark, and made me think .. much like the Lynch movies you seem to like so much (but in my opinion, even thinking about watching anything by him is a complete waste of my time) But the question I was left asking is, why don't you take your attitude to sport into everyday life? I went to a boarding school where sport was compulsory, and used as a weapon (method of punishment), and so since then I have found it very difficult to enjoy any form of group sporting activity (rugby, football etc) or indeed running. Like you, I also like to take an individual, existentialist if you will, view of physical activities. Cycling, surfing and snowboarding are things that I enjoy, when played out in an absence of competition, unless you count getting one over on cab drivers at the lights. I always have at the forefront of my mind, that I could easily be mashed by the nearest bus or van .. knocked out and drowned under a violent wave .. splintered and smashed against a snow covered tree. These thoughts don't however, stop me from doing these activities. They may temper my rashness, but they also add to the excitement. The knowledge that you are just about in control of something that could pinch out your tiny fire, is in a way empowering. But then all of life should be like that; every moment you are still alive, a tiny miracle to be celebrated. Obviously, another person's death can be truly devastating. As you know I lost someone I was very much in love with, 8 years ago almost to the day. She loved her life as an A&amp;R scout, and there was so much more she wanted to do. So every time I go to a gig, I think about what she would have made of the band. But I still go to the gigs.  You never get over the death of someone you care about; you just get used to it. I think you're afraid of having an emotional response to something, in case it weakens you in some way, either in yours or others opinion of you. But to live you must feel. Grief is life. Sure, when you're dead you have no problems; you have nothing at all; you are nothing. But I figure that, seeing as you started this course of yours to make the world a better place and help provide sanitation and fresh water to people that don't have it, you don't really want to be nothing.
If you've had enough of the course .. jack it in .. make a change. Dead people don't get to make choices. Anyway, there's no such thing as bad decisions, just alternative outcomes. Unless of course the decision is to top yourself, because that's a decision that stops you making anymore decisions, and that's just plain stupid.
Now get on with jumping through educational hoops for godsake .. and if you find yourself thinking hard about the meaning of life at 3 in the morning, remember those who don't have the luxury .. have a bit of a cry or something .. (I've found Nam Myoho Renge Kyo also helps - look it up on Wikipedia) .. and get on with living
Lots of Love
Alex

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[If
If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or, being hated, don't give way to hating,
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;
If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;
If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with triumph and disaster
And treat those two imposters just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,
And stoop and build 'em up with wornout tools;
If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
And never breath a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on";
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with kings - nor lose the common touch;
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;
If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run -
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
And - which is more - you'll be a Man my son!

<p>This is probably going to end up as a long moan, sorry about that, I know it's my fault the way things are:</p>
<p>Term ended yesterday and it's been another tough 10 weeks. I'm exhausted and there's still plenty to do. 5 pieces of coursework and three exams to revise for over Christmas. Engineering is properly hard - at least I think so. <br />It's a good thing I don't have a social life, as I wouldn't be able to have one anyway with the amount of work we have to do. And the difficultly level has gone up a few notches this term, some of the Maths lectures have been mind melting - especially when it's a mono-tonal Finnish man, who is hard to understand, filling a board with equations I've never seen before, at lightening speed, who is doing the teaching...It makes me nostalgic for our Croatian Maths lecturer who used to laugh all the time when she was explaining theories and solving problems. I don't think I've ever met anyone who found such joy in life and while I couldn't quite see why exponential functions are funny, she did. I guess it takes all sorts to make up the species...</p>
<p>What can I say that I haven't said before? Not a lot really. I'm still not sure if I really want to see this through, but don't know what to do instead. The only cure for this disease is to kill the patient. Like other daily intrusive thoughts, it's best not dwelt on. (I was watching a TV drama a couple of weeks back where one character said, &quot;<em>I don't think I've experienced a genuine feeling in years.</em>&quot; and I thought - you and me both pal.)</p>
<p>I am finding the more I learn, the more amazed I am that anything actually happens when I switch on a light or open a tap. It is hard to comprehend how complicated the world in which we live is, once one starts to analyse it. We wrote a 46 page report just looking at one road junction for our Transport Engineering coursework and it wasn't even a large junction. <br />And it's just as bad when one is trying to understand what is going on at the small scale, such as what it takes to make a piece of metal fatigue and fracture. It can take several pages of calculations for one component which could be from a bridge containing hundreds of components. A necessary procedure if one wants at least some certainty that a design will not fail and kill people.<br />I've probably said this before, but it's all the mental gear changing we do all the time that I find makes it so hard. And I think my attempts to detail the scope of civil engineering in my last post shows what I mean by that.</p>
<p>Y'know, I've been looking the archives and it seems I write the same stuff every December - banging on about how tired I am and how I like the light - this is why writing things down is a bad idea, it becomes a record of just how tedious everyone actually is. </p>

<p>T.S. Eliot may have had April down as the cruelest month, but November and December both rank highest for me. So perhaps it's best to heed Stuart Sutherland's words, ‘Be wary of your memory: you are likely to recall whatever fits with your current views.’ And to think of what is in the present rather than what is gone, what is broken and what can never be fixed.</p>
<p>It's four weeks into the second year of my degree and therefore four weeks into my third year in Southampton at University. Time dilates such that each day seem long and intense, while the months and weeks seem to contract and pass quickly. Including this year, I have another three years before I graduate.</p>
<p>This year then my timetable consists of the following subjects: Construction Management, Transport Engineering, Hydraulics, Structures &amp; Dynamics, Soil Mechanics, Materials and Statistics. I won't go into them one by one as I can't imagine you'd be interested, but here is some detail of what we do.<br />As the course progresses the theoretical aspects, the parts shared with all sciences, Newtonian physics and such are starting to diverge and become more empirically based and specific to Civil Engineering. That is to say that when it comes to really building something like a water supply network or even just a building, the level of complexity involved rises to a level where it's too difficult to use purely theoretically derived equations to analyse a problem. So the equations become based on coefficients derived by experiment - excuse me if I'm being patronising here - For example to understand what effect how rough the inside of pipe is has on water flowing through it, someone had to make a lot of pipes with different roughness's and measure the flow of water through them. This results in a number (a coefficient) for each degree of roughness, representing the loss of flow caused by the roughness that one can use to multiply theoretical values (such as a pipe with a length of x metres long) to calculate an accurate prediction for what would happen if one was to really make the pipe and put water through it. </p>
<p>That's all pretty dull and I know most people don't care how they get their water or how the roads work etc., just as long as they do, but this gives you some idea of how solutions are arrived at. This kind of approach is used all the time in Engineering because it's just too difficult to model accurately the real world with our present abilities in Maths and Physics. Besides which these kinds of approximations are often sufficient for what it is we are trying to do. </p>
<p>Just to pop back on my soapbox for a moment, often I find people think of scientists and engineers as doing some kind of exclusive magic, but all they are doing is problem solving using a particular kind of method and probably one you use yourself all the time without thinking about it. It develops into this systematic, mathematical approach because it saves time, it saves money and some people are interested to see if it can describe something fundamental about reality. Personally I love it when the equations all come together and something complex can be described in a simple powerful expression, to me it reinforces ideas about what it means to be human. If reality can be described through a series of connections described by equations, then that says something to me about how all life is connected. Which is one reason I get frustrated with our explicable, but often narrow minded behaviour/world-view as a species. </p>
<p>As usual my inability to think in straight lines means I've completely digressed. I was trying to convey something of theoretical aspects of my studies and before I move onto the practical side I should add what else the theory is about. We look at how structures and materials behave under loads such as people or wind or changes in temperature. How traffic moves along roads and through junctions. How the ground on which we build behaves. (This all being necessary prior to any actual construction.)&nbsp; <br />The practical side of the course is then how all this gets used and work gets done in the world today and throws up lots of interesting questions about policies and methods. So in Construction Management we learn all about Health and Safety Laws and the actual process of a building project - which is extraordinary in that it fails to serve almost everyone involved! Likewise with Transport Engineering, it will come as no surprise to discover that we don't really have a Transport Policy in this country. So while the skills have been developed to solve the problems from an Engineering aspect, we lack the governance to enact sensible solutions. Two other interesting points arising from the Transport module were Home Delivery and the matter of data collection. </p>
<p>Studies into the rise of Home Delivery since the Internet has become established show increases in congestion due to use of both delivery vans and the use of cars by people during time that would otherwise be spent travelling to and from the shops. So rather than reducing traffic, Internet shopping increases it as it frees up time for people to do other things and make more journeys. Counter-Intuitive, is it not?<br />Secondly, the matter of data collection and privacy. In reference to my earlier remarks about empirical methods, statistical data is another way of analysing a real situation and very detailed data may provide useful information for devising solutions. In the case of traffic, this could mean recording traffic flows at a particular place, which in turn could involve recording number plates, which if cross referenced with addresses would give a detailed overview of what journeys are occurring. This could be very useful to Engineers to help find measures to improve flows and reduce journey times - indeed if you have an Oystercard, I would expect this is what London Underground try to do - but what else could this information be used for? who is allowed to see it? and who can gather it? Given that we live in a country where it's possible to lock people up for months without charging them or even telling them what they are charged with, these are not trivial matters and all sorts of Engineering use things like RFID tags which effectively monitor people as well as things. </p>
<p>I've probably said many times what a massive subject Civil Engineering is - from the bending of a beam to freedom of information - it covers a lot of things and the simplest question often unfolds (at least in my mind, maybe not in other students!) into an answer of huge complexity. Hopefully what I've written above gives you some sense of this and what I'm learning about in not too boring a way.</p>
<p>Other than studying, it's been the usual run, swim and book/film/music cycle. I've become a bit more involved with the swimming club and have built our Website and taken on the role of Competition Team Manager. This is because I don't like to race and they needed someone to handle bureaucracy of swim events. I'm not coaching. </p>
<p>Book wise I've been rather haunted by a science fiction novel I read a couple of weeks back. It was something like a British Philip K. Dick or Jack Womack book about how the world has decayed environmentally to the point where Mass Suicides are sanctioned by the government and are a regular event as people seek to escape. A really disturbing book about belief that my mind keeps returning to. Dark Heavens by Roger Levy if you're interested.</p>
<p>Finally, the picture is from my window at 7.30 this morning. One thing I like about this time of year is the light, though I can never quite catch it exactly. Not the way Edward Hopper does. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's unusual for me to watch a proper French Art Film and having just finished spending three hours watching one I remember why. I can't decide whether it was absolute rubbish or if it was completely brilliant. All that lyrical talking makes my head hurt. Anyway it's called <strong>'King's and Queen'</strong> and is available on DVD for anyone that is interested. If you watch it, let me know what you think. I reckon having invested three hours of my life watching it makes me want to convince myself it was good!</p>
<p>It did get me thinking that having not written on here for a while I could use it to make a record of the best things I've watched, seen and read over the summer for myself and anyone who may wish to check things out. And what with school finally starting tomorrow, now is the time to do it. So here in no particular order are my hi-lights from the last four months of books, films and music. By the way, the sidebar with the books and music lists takes you straight to the Amazon page for each item :</p>
<p><strong><u>Music</u></strong> - There's so much I've been exposed to in four months it's hard to narrow it down, some great individual tracks as well as albums, but here's six recent repeat plays from the album selections: </p>
<p><strong>Juana Molina - Tres Cosas</strong> : Supplied by Neil and it's been on a lot this week. She has a great voice, this Argentinian singer. Some kind of electronica folk thing.</p>
<p><strong>Extra Golden - OK-Oyet System</strong>: I came across this lot on the Thrill Jockey Label website, home of post-rock bands and it's Kenya meets US Indie rock. Sprawling tracks, but I like it cos it's different.</p>
<p><strong>Micah P. Hinson - Micah P. Hinson and the Opera</strong>: Another donation from Neil to my collection. I've been listening to a lot of Country as usual, the true home of melancholy music. This album is beautiful. (Sackville and Sin Ropas deserve a mention too.)</p>
<p><strong>The Triffids - Born Sandy Devotional</strong>: Sort of Australia's version of Country and a re-visitation for me after some years. Still plenty of brilliant tracks on here. Tender is the Night is outstanding.</p>
<p><strong>Dangermouse - The Grey Album</strong>: Dangermouse came to my attention because of Gnarls Barkley and he's now working with Sparklehorse too. This is his mix of Jay-Z's The Black Album with The Beatles The White Album. Strange, but addictive.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Hawley - Cole's Corner</strong>: Essentially an impression of Scott Walker circa 1965, but enjoyable nonetheless and I keep going back to it.</p>
<p><strong><u>Books</u></strong>, also lots to choose from, another six here:</p>
<p><strong>Irrationality: The Enemy Within by Stuart Sutherland</strong>: Probably something everyone should read. Brought to my attention from a posting on the Bad Science website forum about the best science books. A systematic description of ways in which humans are irrational and the consequences by a clinical psychologist. Funny as well as chilling at times.</p>
<p><strong>The Rise and Fall of the Third Chimpanzee by Jared Diamond</strong> : A good companion to Irrationality. This book is an explanation of our animal heritage, the ways in which humans are unique and the ways in which we are like other animals. It is also a description of how we have spread around the world and what we have done in the process. It flags up loads of unanswered questions too. A great book for anyone who wonders like me <em>'Why are things the way they are?'</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Practical DemonKeeping by Christopher Moore</strong> and <strong>The Devil You Know by Mike Carey </strong>: I put these two together cos they are both horror novels, with comedy thrown in. Sounds bad, but Christopher Moore made me laugh more than any other author this summer. The Mike Carey book is set around near where I work in London so I liked that aspect.</p>
<p><strong>Forty Signs of Rain by Kim Stanley Robinson</strong> : Why more novelists don't write about Global Warming I don't know. While a lot people seem to be getting incensed about what some women wear on their heads or whatever is today's immediate issue of apocalyptic concern, this is probably the real misery maker and killer sneaking up on us all. It's the subject of this novel, but he covers a lot of related ground. I don't particularly like his US-centric view, but I do like the way he makes Scientists into heros! This is the first in a trilogy, part two is also available.</p>
<p><strong>Two Way Split by Allan Guthrie</strong>: Couldn't leave out a crime novel. A recent Scottish novel with undertones of Jim Thompson. </p>
<p><strong><u>Films</u></strong> - I never seem to make it to the cinema these days and of all the media where I think, <em>'I've seen that before, only better...'</em> (A sure sign of getting old) Film is the one that suffers the most. So I've only got four recent viewings on DVD worth a mention, (Kings and Queen I've already written about):</p>
<p><strong>Shaolin Soccer</strong> : Kung Fu Hustle, also by Stephen Chow is better, but this is very good too. For shear imagination I've not seen much to match his stuff in the last year. Comedy and martial arts might sound awful, but the fact it is so surprising kept me enthralled, I never knew what was going to happen next. One moment it's a crazy fight, then a dance sequence, then slapstick. Got five year old Stan's seal of approval too.</p>
<p><strong>Iron Monkey</strong> : A Nineties Kung Fu classic. Don't mess with the King Kong Paw.</p>
<p><strong>King's Game</strong> : An excellent Danish Political Thriller. (No, really!). Maybe more like a TV show than a Film - I tend to think of a Film as something that tells you stuff through pictures and sounds, not words (which is why I hate voice-over) though sometimes a lot of talking is okay - but it gripped me and was original enough to leave me satisfied. </p>
<p>Looking at my choices it is very male dominated, only one women on the list. Maybe this is just the natural bias in me. I do consume work by women muscians/writers/film makers too, but this is what I've selected this time around and I still think there's some good stuff for everyone in there.</p>
<p>There's no picture this time because I haven't taken any recently and the reason the numbers jumped from 21 to 23 is because as often happens when what I write things, I started writng 22 and then decided it was idiocy and didn't post it. </p>

I have missed your posts. The fact that I have not heard of any of the music films or books that you have ctitiqued does of course mean that I am living in another world (I have heard of Shaolin soccer having said that :)) Actually I AM living in another world. India. A place where the rules on roundabouts are totally opposite to those of the UK. If you are coming onto a roundabout here you have right of way. If you are already on the roundabout you have to give way..... ????!!!! Mad Mad Mad. See more on www.delhidigest.blogspot.com
Hope you hava a successful year at uni.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was thinking about my weblog today and thinking about how (copyrights not withstanding) I wish I could make it like a scrapbook of all my favourite current bits of TV, Books, Music etc. <br />
My computer is slowly evloving into this kind of thing anyway - although not TV clips - and it would be nice to share some of the stuff I come across in a sort of 'Try before you buy' kind of way. It'd be nice to see what other people find too.</p>
<p>One of the things I'm currently reading is a novel by Kim Stanley Robinson. I've never been too sure about this author, there's something I can't quite put my finger on, but is unsatisfying about his work. Maybe it's the characters, maybe the US-centric view of the world. However in his favour, he is one of the few authors I've come across willing to bring together big ideas from across the sciences and make novels out of them. His current series, of which I picked up book two in my local library, is about global warming. The thing that has struck me reading it so far is why aren't there more novels about this? <br />
A particular bugbear of mine over the years is when I hear someone comment something along the lines of, "There is no such thing as absolute truth." It is correct to say, as far I am aware, that scientists cannot say things with strict absolute certainty, but they can say things to a degree of certainty fine enough to make this computer work and allow us all to go on holidays without our planes crashing. The point is that Truth is determined by the boundaries within which one is working. How true does it have to be before one is convinced? <br />
Well, if I compare one report suggesting a link between the MMR vaccine and autism and then subsquently discover that NO follow up studies - that's none, not even one out of the 31 I'm aware of - find any link at all, I'd say that's true enough for me and yet many people are still hestitant about vaccinating their children. <br />
There have been 449 cases of measles in the UK in 2006 up to June compared with 77 in 2005 and in April this year the UK had it's first measles death in 14 years according to the BBC. The child was unvaccinated, although also suffering from an underlying lung conditon. <br />
One of the things that I find frustrating about people still saying stuff about absolute truth is that this discussion was put to bed in the scientific community by people like Guass and Boltzmann in the 19th Century and then by Hesienberg in the early part of the 20th. It's testement to how little or how slowly ideas filter down to society at large from science and where Hesienberg is concerned, how mangled they get along the way. <br />
The irony is that I tend to find that most of us behave as though we have absolute entitlements to a certain way of life and our own particular behaviours, which brings me back to global warming. As a phenomena it's not something I claim to understand in detail, but I do understand how many people from different areas of science are really concerned about what is happening. </p>

<p>Back to misanthropy corner after two weeks camping in France and I'm no closer to figuring out what a person obsessed with television and kinda interested in everything else is supposed to do with life.I find I've been missing some fine TV. Steve Coogan, Rob Brydon and Armando Innaucci all having programmes stuck on in the summer schedules which although not perfect have been enough to force much laughter out of me since my return. And Charlie Brooker keeps lifting his material from my blog, recommending Civilisation, Ascent of Man and The Wire on his Screenwipe show. His impression of Jonathon King is uncanny. It's not that I even particularly like TV but I am obsessed with it, no doubt about it. (I blame Globecast for getting me into Love Island Aftersun though.)</p>
<p>Anyway, holidays. The first picture shows the route we took (in pink, the black dots are where we stayed), first across to Normandy, travelling over 2500 km around France. <br />It ended up being a holiday of bridges and churches, crossing two of the largest cable stay bridges in the world: The Pont du Normandie and the Millau Viaduct as well as visiting the 1000 year old Roman Aqueduct, The Pont du Gard. This and the Millau bridge can be seen above. The deck of the Millau bridge runs at the height of the observation deck of the Empire State building in New York and is over 2 km long. I doubt it will still be there in a thousand year's time, but it is an impressive example of the current abilities of engineers and designers just as the Pont du Gard reflects the state of Roman society in that they could and did build such complex and long lasting infrastructure. I guess Millau reflects just how much we love cars!</p>
<p>Churches also reflect the changing nature of societies over the years. The course has given me more insight into why buildings are the way they are and one of a church's main functions is to impress. How impressive a building is tends to be limited by money and technological ability. So we visited a Baptistery in Poitiers that dates back to Roman times which was a small simple brick design and without stained glassed windows. The windows were in fact made of thin pieces of marble and it was decorated inside with beautiful fresco's. This contrasts greatly with the largest Gothic Cathedral in Europe at Amiens. Huge, complex and carved from limestone with flying buttresses and tall columns. It was decorated all over with intricately carved figures and large stained glass windows. While I can imagine this being very impressive to a person from the middle ages, being from the twentieth century it was the Chapel at Ronchamp, pictured above that impressed on me most. This is a building from the 1950s by Le Corbusier and to me reflects both the change in material use that came about with the development of concrete and steel at the start of the twentieth century and also the change in mindset a product of the intellectual changes in the preceding 100 years. This is just my interpretation, but I see here a building where the concept of a church has been taken apart, just as scientists and engineers were taking apart materials and ideas. It has then been reconstructed through the mind of an artist to make something new in a way impossible before. For example, in a Gothic church one finds the Nave, a vaulted ceiling resembling the hull of a boat, hence the name, the point upwards a necessary part of its structural strength. At Ronchamp this has been inverted, so the point is inwards and it floats above the roof, a shape only possible then using reinforced concrete and this creates something new, yet reminiscent of something familiar. And it's like that throughout making it somehow surprising and reassuring at the same time, which is how I found it impressive.<br />In The Ascent of Man, Bronowski comments that one of the features of Art contrasted with Science is that one can witness both the Artist taking the World apart and putting it back together in their work. We see the process as well as the outcome. (It strikes me that this is one reason why Science will never have the mass appeal of Art. One really has to do Science to find it interesting, but one is given access to Art directly through consumption which is in its self a form of participation.) I think this view of Art can be extended to reading the world we live in and I find it interesting to know and see how things have ended up the way they are and seeing this stuff gives me some clues about that. <br />The last chapel we visited was near Dieppe and is the burial place of the Cubist painter Braque who had made some of the stained glass windows there, one of which I've included here too.</p>
<p>Those are the cultural highlights for me. We also did plenty of drinking and eating: Cheese, Croissants, Eclairs, Wine etc. And we had our obligatory disaster with the exhaust coming apart on Phil's car. That held us up for a couple of days. The weather was a bit hit and miss: Hot and dry in the South. Cold and wet in the North. And windy everywhere. The Sunset picture is from the Poitiers campsite.</p>
<p>The only other thing of note I've done recently was the Pier to Pier charity swim at Bournemouth the week before I went away. I've never done a long open water swim, so it was quite an interesting experience. I don't know how people can swim the Channel though - it's too boring. 44 min 38 sec. was my time over the course distance of 2.35 km. My T15 pace is around 1000m so if I could maintain that pace over the course it would equate to a 35-36 minute swim, which I'd be well pleased with. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/fire1.jpg"><img title="Fire1" height="168" alt="Fire1" src="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/images/fire1.jpg" width="100" border="0" style="float:left;margin:0 5px 5px 0;" /></a> It's hot enough to make my computer malfunction and the air is full of the organic stink of life, even two stories up in my building. <br />I was on the beach just ten days ago in Wales huddled around a fire to keep warm for my biannual June camping trip. If the scientists are right, this is just a taste of the extreme weather to come in future years...</p>
<p>Anyhow, I got my exam results today which is the purpose of this post.</p>
<p>The headline figure is that I managed a year average of 74.3% which means I met my own target of 70%. <br />So that's good and if I was to achieve that every year I'd get a first class degree. (None of this year's grades actually counts towards my final degree.)<br />The full breakdown is as follows, the grades are module averages, for some reason we don't get separate exam and coursework grades, so I don't know my actual exam marks:</p>
<p>Materials 76%<br />Structural Mechanics 64%<br />Mathematics 65%<br />Graphics and Communication 80%<br />Structures 82%<br />Numerical Analysis 78%<br />Surveying 69%<br />Engineering Design 84%<br />Geology 74%<br />Hydraulics 71%</p>
<p>Of these I'm most pleased with Hydraulics, as it is probably the hardest subject conceptually. The Mathematics is a bit disappointing and demonstrates my problems with exams, as I was averaging 90% in the coursework and it's probably my favourite subject! I'm a bit of a tortoise when it comes to Maths and as one of our lecturers said, &quot;If you are having to think during the exam, the battle is probably lost already.&quot;</p>
<p>Since I finished I've been fortunate to be getting a lot of paid work and it provides a nice counterpoint to this educational work and its measurement of success. At work, a successful day is one where things go smoothly and according to plan and no one gets too angry or upset about anything, rather than a simple statistic.</p>
<p>I keep mulling over whether or not to quit the course for several reasons: </p>
<p>One is the financial costs of studying, even with working my old job, I'm accruing around £5000 of debt a year in student loans. Two years in and three to go. </p>
<p>Secondly, I've always had a chip on my shoulder since school about being stupid and not up to achieving in Education and I know that I can do it now, so a part of my motivation for doing this is now gone.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there is the subject itself and near constant state of frustration I find in studying it and that my future will be difficult when and if I graduate. If I try to have a career working in the Industry, I've been told my age is against me and that the alternative is to pursue a career in Academia as a researcher.</p>
<p>So what to do? I dunno.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's the end of the first year of my degree and I thought I ought to write some kind of summary of what I've done in the last eight months. </p>
<p>Douglas Coupland in 'Hey Nostradamus!' describes everyone carrying a 'glory meter' around with them. This is an invisible device that prompts one to say things that help to convey to others the sense of the importance of ones existence such as, &quot;Ken says I make the best coffee outside of Italy.&quot; or &quot;I once nearly won the Southern England Go-Kart Championships.&quot; This is instead of just regarding ones life all just being a futile and pointless exercise - my default setting. (By the way, I make OK coffee, I don't know anyone called Ken and I haven't ever been in a Go-Kart competition.)</p>
<p>So this is the opportunity to crank my glory meter into action. </p>
<p>I don't what this says about my priorities, but the thing I feel best about from the last eight months is swimming ten kilometres last week. It's the first time I done over 10k in a week, over 4 sessions and I did a 3k session for the second time only. This following on from the formal establishment of a new Masters swimming club here. And I did 100m in 1m 16s, which I think is a PB, though times are not really that important to me. Some people meditate, some take drugs or any number of things to find some peace of mind. For me the endless task of trying to cut perfectly through the water gets me close. Running also comes close, but oddly I usually feel less self conscious in the pool. (My millionaire's fantasy involves having my own 50 metre pool.) <br />To give some perspective, Australian Olympian Grant Hackett swims about 70k a week in his training. And I did my 10k in about 4 hours, he's probably doing 10k about every 2.5 to 3 hours. I learnt to swim properly in 2000, so I'm pleased with my progress.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Second to all this, but taking far more of my time has been the course. It's been toughest in the sense of time as the workload is pretty relentless for engineers (of all sorts). I think this is partly to do with the fact that engineering is a place where 'the real world' and scientific theory meet - a bit like medicine I guess, mostly less dangerous, sometimes more - so we have to switch gears constantly between thinking about something purely abstract such as Maths and the practicalities of actually doing something like a building a power station with <em>all</em> the possible consequences.<br />This year has been about doing some core subjects that affect almost everything in the built environment, so that's - Maths, Structural Mechanics (aka Newtonian Physics), Geology, Surveying, Materials, Hydraulics (aka Fluid Mechanics), Computer Programming, Graphics and Communications. <br />Here's a theoretical example of why all this is necessary: If London doesn't have enough electricity generation for all the people and all their stuff, how does that get sorted? Well, first one needs a plan and for a plan as much as one should have imagination, one must consult and discuss with the public and people in power the options and consequences of each option. So there's the Graphics and Communication requirement. And when drawing up a range of options, one must do the sums correctly and make a correct assessment of possible options, which is where all the Maths, Physics and Geology etc. comes in. There'd be no point in advocating a wind farm if the soil on a site isn't strong enough to support the windmills, or building a gas fired power plant on a flood plain for example. When a plan is agreed upon, the design must be done in detail, so the knowledge of materials comes into play. For example a real piece of steel is not like a theoretical, perfect piece of steel and knowing the differences and limitations is essential. And I've talked about the significance of being able to measure things accurately before. Once a plan is agreed upon, all the abstract calculations created during this process must be then conveyed as a design that can be worked from and understood by everyone working on the project and ultimately communicated to the public/users. So there should be a sense in which communication skills and the science become integrated in the mind of a engineer. Sadly, this often isn't the case and hence the reputation for the poor social skills of engineers.<br />So what I've been doing is following one process of learning scientific theories and then translating that into a design process, which then eventually becomes the built environment we inhabit. We've really only just been introduced to things, even working as hard as we do and I do find it quite mind blowing if I think about how complicated things actually are for any length of time! <br />Personally, I'd like to broaden it out even more, as the moral and ethical questions all this raises are peripheral to the course. As I've said before it affects everyone, but most people are not able to or don't choose to engage with this world changing process. <br />I should probably clarify that design from an engineering point of view is primarily about making something that is safe more than how it looks and feels. Aesthetics are really a form of engineering specialisation, such as being an architect. Originally, there was no distinction between Civil Engineers and Architects, but increased complexity inevitably leads to specialisation. Still, as almost everything has to be done as part of team process, it's generally misleading when people say something was 'designed' by one genius individual. There may well be a leader, but they have to draw from the ideas and expertise of a whole range of people and find ways to integrate competing priorities and a design in the general sense is the outcome of this process.<br />In terms of my day to day, the course has two halves, a lot of working through engineering problems based on our lectures, essentially Maths and Physics and secondly doing laboratory work, experiments and field visits based on material from the lectures. The latter half generating reports, of which I've written somewhere between 20,00 and 30,000 words in the last three months. </p>
<p>Following on from my soaking up of 'Civilisation', I got hold of the next series David Attenborough commissioned. It's a kind of companion piece to 'Civilisation', with a splendidly sexist title, 'The Ascent of Man'. Once one has got past the jarring way everything has a male prefix - it was made in 1973 - it's a brilliant account of the evolution of global societies through environmental conditions and 'scientific' discovery. This juxtaposes nicely with the previous series account of Western European society through Art and Architecture. I put scientific in quotes because science as separate discipline is a relatively recent phenomena, but ultimately it was experimentation by humans (or man, as this series prefers!) that led to the progress from hunters to the kind of technological society we have today. One thing that struck a chord with me was the highlighting of how its the interaction between humans and their discoveries, not the discovery itself, that is the key point in determining what happens next. Having the luxury of time to think and reflect is only possible once humans moved beyond just surviving and Jacob Bronowski shows how this happened and what was necessary for it to happen.</p>
<p>Now I have nearly four months before I return to studying. Having just finished today, I'm a bit shocked at the ending of such an intense period of time and don't really know how I feel about it or even what I should feel about it. I think mostly that life is disappointing whatever one does.</p>

Aside from your opening and closing comments of life being futile, pointless and disappointing you seem to communicate the content, relevance and direction of your course and studies very well. Perhaps your vocation lies in communication; the translation of the engineering concepts into reality through your good and concise communication of the ideas and feedback that are obviously necessary to the completion of projects. In this way your training as an engineer could help tackle '... the reputation for the poor social skills of engineers' using your undoubted '...sense in which communication skills and the science become integrated in the mind of an engineer.'

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/gradbach_trees.jpg"><img title="Gradbach_trees" height="133" alt="Gradbach_trees" src="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/images/gradbach_trees.jpg" width="100" border="0" style="float:left;margin:0 5px 5px 0;" /></a> It's nice when I see people and they say they like my blog and ask when I'm gonna post again, as my usual attitude in life is that 99% of the things I think of to say are not worth saying and the 1% that I think is, on reflection, actually isn't either . So I either write it and delete it or don't bother in the first place. But here I am again: </p>
<p>The picture on the left here is from the week I spent in Derbyshire as part of my course making a map aka surveying. It was a hard week,as it was quite a physically and mentally strenuous activity - walking up and down the hills for 8-10 hours a day doing something that is repetitive yet requires a high level of precision. And working with five 19 year old boys, whose personalities ranged from Kevin The Teenager to fully functioning Adults. I hope at some point to be able to upload the map and some photos for anyone who cares to see. The area was about the size of three or four football pitches and took five days to map. </p>
<p>Apart from the confirmation that I do not want to be a surveyor, the thing it got me thinking about again was the invisibility and necessity of engineering. When I got back I watched the end of the Civilisation series I've mentioned before in which he describes the humanising (and de-humanising) effects of Engineering from the 19Th and into the 20Th Century. It was one of the thoughts I had as I stood in the rain with a tripod and theodolite measuring angles, that this is the sort of problem (i.e. making maps) that needs to be solved in order for a society to evolve to the point where people can do things like have discussions about Heat magazine or gender roles in society or Privacy or are Mac's better than PCs or whatever. Of course people can discuss these things without maps or Engineering developments, but I can't help thinking it's the infrastructure engineering has created that has been central to these things coming into existence. </p>
<p>Which tied into other thoughts I'd been having about how so much of the Engineering (and therefore society) we have is a product of history and expediency rather than grand planning. Here's a for instance: We've been studying Water Wheels in Fluid Dynamics. Up to about 150 years ago these were really popular in England and helped start the industrial revolution for powering factories and mills etc. This was the early days of formal science and engineering practice, so research was not really a well established field and most of what was known about water wheels was from trial and error. When coal and then oil was discovered as a source of power, this technology was more or less abandoned, people looked at fossil fuels as being infinite in supply and didn't consider the long term consequences. So here we are today having built our global infrastructure around fossil fuels wondering about all the problems both social and environmental we've created and what to do about them. That's a whole other story, my point here is that no-one knows what Water Wheels are capable of because no-ones ever asked properly. <br />It's part of a familiar theme from me, '&quot;Why don't people try to see how it all fits together? And why are they all in their little boxes thinking their bit is the important bit when it's all important?&quot; followed by a big sigh and the sound of me opening another beer and then hitting the delete key.</p>
<p>It's fair to say I don't like my course very much, but when I think about quitting one of the few things that stops me is that I feel to need to actually have some understanding of how things work in order to have the right to have an opinion on them (and potentially to do something.) And it bothers me that most people seem to be under the impression that truth is just some semantic subjective thing that cannot be tested in some way and that this belief then undermines attempts to discuss why the hell so many people are still living short painful lives and that inequality is the default setting for human life.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In many conversations over the years I've said I think Art and Science are the essentially the same thing, a drive to express/understand something about the nature of Reality and our experience of it. And so it is with Engineering. Though I sometimes wonder if Engineers egos are even more out of control than those of Artists and Scientists, as they keep getting together and imposing monstrosities such as Chernobyl on the world. So when I'm back downloading our map data onto the laptop and it draws a little map representing all our hard work, boring as it was to do, I'm blown away at the ingenuity it took for someone to figure out how to do that and all the things maps allow us to do. </br>And I'm also thinking what questions aren't being asked that should be? What problems aren't being solved that should and could be? What would it be like if everyone thought a little about this stuff - how it works and why we got where we are - asked questions and held all our leaders to account? </br>As often happens I find myself back with Adam Smiths Invisible Hand. The hand is good, it just needs guidance and that is a product of inquiry - what does self-interest really mean? </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/iow_geology_trip_035.jpg"><img title="Iow_geology_trip_035" height="133" alt="Iow_geology_trip_035" src="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/images/iow_geology_trip_035.jpg" width="100" border="0" style="float:left;margin:0 5px 5px 0;" /></a> It has been a very long three months since I had either the time or inclination to post on here. Coursework and Exams endlessly in succession, so that when I handed in my final piece of work for this term a short while ago, I thought, 'What next?' and was a bit confused to find there is nothing I'm supposed to be doing right now. My next deadline isn't for a month. Allegedly, the Engineers have the fullest timetable of all students and it certainly feels that way.</p>
<p>So it's all been a bit grim really, I've probably learnt quite a lot, but there's been little pleasure in the process and my toleration levels for being around other people have been at an all time low. </p>
<p>Since Xmas, the emphasis has moved more from theoretical understanding to empirical based ways of understanding. This is really then the difference between pure science and Engineering. In Maths a purely analytic solution to a problem - one based on equations - to describe reality is sometimes (though far from always) possible. Such as Pi r-squared to describe the area of a circle. <br />Many situations, and the ones Engineering is concerned with, require solutions which are essentially very good approximations derived from what is actually observable, through experiments and tests which produce numbers with a real world meaning, such as the strength of a material like steel. And if that sounds simple, here's a Betrand Russell quote that neatly sums up my feelings about trying to design a concrete beam to a level of confidence that it won't fall down and kill anyone,</p>
<p><em>&quot;Everything is vague to a degree you do not realise until you have tried to make it precise.&quot;</em></p>
<p>A block of concrete, how complicated can that be? Very! And then there's other stuff, like how do fluids flow? How does one make sense of the Earth, it's age and formation and behaviour? Little of it is intuitive and these things all coincide in the real world of building stuff, so the level of complexity soon gives rise to the conclusion of how limited we would be without computers to deal with the calculations. My tutor said to us the other day, 30,000 equations on a civil engineering project is a small number. Hence we also have to get some understanding of how computers really work, so that we can have confidence in the models we create for testing and the answers they produce.</p>
<p>Now depending on whether or not you care about the True Nature of Reality in an objective sense, (I do but I have no justification as to why, in fact I'm sure it doesn't matter at all really, it's just another way to pass the time) this is all very interesting. Then someone (a tutor or guest lecturer usually) goes and ruins it all with a more human interpretation of reality, the profit motive and it all becomes very boring and it becomes clear why we live in such a rubbish world of crap buildings and starving people.</p>
<p>It is very paradoxical to me how Adam Smith's Invisible Hand of Self Interest can drive us to produce all this amazing understanding and technology and Art etc. while at the same time promoting inequality and mediocrity. I was thinking about Standardisation the other day (standard sizes of paper, distances, screws etc.) and how life as we have it now would be impossible without it (and yet people still can't give up the mile or the inch) but how when it is a tool used for profit it produces the blandness of ubiquity - imagine a world of only Ikea furniture and Ipods. Doesn't matter how good something is, without variety it becomes oppressive.</p>
<p>So I don't know just how possible it will be for me to ever make a career in Civil Engineering be an experience that is about more than just making a profit, if I ever get a degree, but if it isn't I'll just have to study Maths part-time and learn about Reality whilst living in reality.</p>
<p>As I've been spurning human company, (other than to swim with and one can't talk and swim at the same time) I've been cutting the Engineering by watching DVDs. In particular Kenneth Clark's 1969 series Civilisation, which is a documentary series about the history of Western Europe since the Romans through Art and Architecture. I can't recommend it highly enough. One you get past how slow it is (this is a good thing) and have taken on the dated nature of some of his opinions (it is pretty much exclusively male), it's genuinely uplifting. It's all about humanity, the desire to be better and understand more and how this becomes expressed through Art. My favourite quote so far comes from the 12th century Cardinal, Pierre Abelard:</p>
<p><em>&quot;The beginning of wisdom is found in doubting; by doubting we come to the question and by seeking we may come upon the truth.&quot;</em></p>
<p>I wonder what he'd make of all the fundamentalism and dogma in the world today? And watching this series serves to make me more passionate about the need for reason over nonsense and mumbo jumbo and blind acceptance of irrational rubbish that goes on everywhere I look from my own classroom to the News and our political and business leaders. And how the battle against prejudice and inequality is endless and must be fought daily in small ways everywhere. <br />It would be so sad if the idiots win and drag us back down when all these people like Abelard and the Artists in this series have striven so hard to civilise the world. I think it's well known I'm not a big fan of humans, but this does show some of their best aspects and if you like Art and being made to think in new ways about why things are the way they are, then this is for you.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you might prefer to watch The Wire, the best TV show not available on TV. I've mentioned it before, but it's so good if you like crime drama. And I mean crime in the widest sense, not narrow cops and robbers simple stuff. All human life is there in the Wire. Rent it from Amazon.</p>
<p>Well, I didn't really think about this much in advance, so if it makes no real sense I'll have to edit it later cos it's time to go to the Pool. We had the Annual Swimming Gala last week which I was in for the first time - 2nd in the T-shirt race - what a result!</p>
<p>And I just stuck in a picture from my geology field trip to the Isle of Wight where I had lunch on the beach on the one spring day this year so far.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&quot;Science is a way of trying not to fool yourself. The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool&quot;</em> Richard Feynman, 1964.</p>
<p>13 weeks to go to the end of my PhD - well, of my money anyway. It&#039;s reached that point where it&#039;s become a real monkey on my back.</p>
<p>And I keep meaning to write something down, but it&#039;s been such busy and hard year so far, my thoughts are largely negative. But it will also be over soon and I&#039;ve documented nothing of my thoughts and feelings this year.</p>
<p>I try not to over-think, which is tricky for someone who has been described as hypervilgilant (you know who you are). But I had one of those&quot;This is it&quot; moments last week when I was at <a href="http://www.parkrun.org.uk/" target="_blank" title="ParkRun">ParkRun</a>. I was running across the Common, one lap to go, trying to catch my team mate Mark in the golden September sunshine tracking three swans flying close overhead like miniature Concords. Not for the first time, but for the first time in a while I found myself talking to myself, &quot;This is it. This is your life. Some of these trees were here before you and some will be here long after you&#039;ve gone. Everyone running here, the swans and the other creatures will die and we&#039;ll all be forgotten and eventually the Universe will die too. You&#039;re a speck and it&#039;s not fair and there&#039;s no meaning other than what you choose to give it. So remember to at least try and enjoy it and use it as wisely as you can. This is what <em>you</em> get.&quot;</p>
<p>So I thought I better write something, anything, down for my own benefit.</p>
<p>The first three months of the year I remember as dash to try and progress experiments that have been on-going without success for over 2 years now. Then it was off to Cambridge for three months at my co-sponsors Microsoft Research.</p>
<p>I tried really hard to enjoy my time in Cambridge, but it was mostly an intense experience that I was doing my best to survive. It perhaps didn&#039;t help that my lodgings were not ideal, but other than that everyone was very welcoming.</p>
<p>Then it was back to Southampton for another month of trying to get the experiments working and then off to work on the Olympics in TV. Which was hard work, but successful and very instructive in reminding me of both the differences and similarities between academia and industry. On balance, I came away thinking that my time is more valuable to me than money, so while I can and would do either, at the moment I still value the academic route to the industry one - if they&#039;ll have me.</p>
<p>Now it&#039;s head down and try to get things finished - which is perhaps the major issue for me with academia, things never seem satisfactorily complete! Which as &quot;hurry up, completer&quot; (you know who you are too) I find really annoying.</p>
<p>Hmmm...just realised I&#039;ve labelled myself twice in this post. I hate labels.</p>
<p>I&#039;m writing this whilst I wait for my samples to de-frost so I can
set-up an experiment to run overnight. Not often I work on the weekend,
but needs must.</p>
<p>Changing the subject entirely, props to Phil for sending me Sight and Sound with their Greatest Films of All Time poll. This of course got me making my own list, although I only managed 7 out of 10 so far!</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053198/" target="_blank" title="The 400 Blows">The 400 Blows</a></p>
<p>2. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046438/" target="_blank" title="Tokyo Story">Tokyo Story</a></p>
<p>3. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1100048/" target="_blank" title="35 Shots of Rum">35 Shots of Rum</a></p>
<p>4. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1827487/" target="_blank">Once upon a time in Antolia</a></p>
<p>5. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053472/" target="_blank">Breathless</a></p>
<p>6. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040522/" target="_blank">The Bicycle Theives</a></p>
<p>7. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071360/" target="_blank">The Conversation</a></p>
<p>There are so many other great films I could make a huge list, but these are ones I think are truly great - today!</p>
<p>Discuss.</p>
<p>More later.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/37f87-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201675f380801970b-120wi.jpg" style="display:inline;"><img alt="Presents" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201675f380801970b" src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/37f87-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201675f380801970b-120wi.jpg" title="Presents" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Radio</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Having had a nice weekend in London, I managed to come down with Norovirus or something similar this week. It completely wiped me out and brought my working year to an abrupt and unplanned end. Nature giving me a reminder of the illusion that is &quot;being in control.&quot;</p>
<p>(I&#039;d just given Thea a book on viruses as a present. If I&#039;d stuck around she could have had a real life case-study to accompany the text.)</p>
<p>&#160;Anyhow, the upside of being ill and not spending my time thinking about protein molecules - other than to wish they&#039;d do their job a bit quicker - was listening to the radio. I tend to forget what a great thing it is.</p>
<p>So I&#039;ve listened to lots of science and current affairs stuff on Radio 4 and music on Radio 6, but my hi-light has been the ﻿<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0184yvg" target="_blank" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0184yvg">The People&#039;s Post: A Narrative History of the Post Office. </a></p>
<p>It&#039;s one of those little 15 minute gems that only the BBC make. There are 15 episodes and I know I won&#039;t have time to go back and listen to them all, but it is a fascinating way of thinking about the development of our society.</p>
<p>If you only have time for one, follow this link and listen to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/console/b018flpn" target="_blank" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/console/b018flpn">The Post Code</a>. It&#039;s just a perfect documentation of humans response to new technology. Auberon Waugh was pretty much the Jeremy Clarkson of his day. It&#039;s also great at demonstrating how we can&#039;t know in advance the consequences of new technology.</p>
<p>On the science side I&#039;ve been enjoying the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/timc" target="_blank" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/timc">Infinite Monkey Cage</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/tls" target="_blank" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/tls">The Life Scientific</a> and (not strictly speaking Radio) the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/series/science" target="_blank" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/series/science">Guardian Science Weekly</a>.</p>
<p><strong>PhD</strong></p>
<p><strong> <a href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/22703-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201675f38fa47970b-120wi.jpg" style="display:inline;"><img alt="MHC-Map-web" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201675f38fa47970b" src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/22703-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201675f38fa47970b-120wi.jpg" title="MHC-Map-web" /></a><br /><br /></strong>Following on from last time and for the uninitiated: a thesis is the argument that is contained within the dissertation that I will have submit in order to receive the Doctor of Philosophy qualification.</p>
<p>In the domain of science, the thesis is generally some novel findings that increase our knowledge about a particular subject.</p>
<p>Without going into detail about unpublished work and being any more boring than is necessary, the general thrust of my work is to push forward our understanding about a key protein in our immune system that helps protect us against viruses, cancer and autoimmune disease.</p>
<p>It&#039;ll be a tiny, little incremental step forward if I get there, but such is the complexity of biology, progress is hard-fought.</p>
<p>And although I work under the banner of Cancer Science - there really is no way at present for it to have any meaningful impact the treatment of cancer. Maybe one day it&#039;ll be a useful piece of the puzzle, maybe never, but that&#039;s the beauty of science, no-one really knows in advance what will turn out to be useful!</p>
<p>My favourite quote of the week - definitely going on my heuristic list - <em>&quot;Science is the best way we have of not fooling ourselves&quot;</em> from <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/audio/2011/dec/12/science-weekly-podcast-higgs-boson" target="_blank" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/audio/2011/dec/12/science-weekly-podcast-higgs-boson">Jon Butterworth</a>.</p>
<p>The work itself is a kind of dance between computational, mathematical methods and experimentation.</p>
<p>I was aiming to get a purely computational component of my work looking at how the structure of the protein moves finished before Christmas, but failed! Once that&#039;s done, I&#039;ll be back in the lab trying to bring to fruition the experimental component that has been ongoing for nearly two years without a lot of success. Then in March I&#039;m off to Cambridge for three months to develop another computational model and hopefully learn some new Maths. Then it&#039;s back to Southampton to finish up and write a thesis.</p>
<p>By the end of 2012 then I would aim to have some coherent new insights regarding the structure of the protein and its behaviour in forming a complex - that is to say a larger molecule comprising of three different molecules - that together can trigger an immune response in our bodies.</p>
<p>Ultimately it&#039;s about delivery. If I deliver something new and meaningful then it&#039;s possible that there will be more money to do more research. That&#039;s how it works and it&#039;s highly competitive and we&#039;re all feeling the pressure in my group.</p>
<p>In as much as I have my own work to do, it&#039;s really a team effort. I&#039;ve included here the project map I drew - aka the Tube Map - to depict how everyone currently involved interacts. It gives a sense of how many people and disciplines are involved in untangling something so complicated. My boss Tim is King&#039;s Cross as he&#039;s involved with every aspect.</p>
<p>The credits list on my dissertation is going to be a cast of thousands at this rate too. A feature of my PhD is that annoying buzzword &quot;interdisciplinary&quot; - which I tend to think of as synonymous with &quot;multi-tasking&quot; i.e. &quot;doing a lot of things badly rather than one thing well&quot;. My solution is to rope in as much expertise as possible to help me out and hence the many links I have on the map and many people I have to thank!</p>
<p>When I think of myself I tend to think of myself as an Engineer. I was never really much of an Artist and I&#039;m not much of Scientist, but I have some aptitude for problem solving, getting stuck into the unglamourous stuff and getting things done - albeit imperfectly - which is what I think Engineer&#039;s do. My friend Hannah used the term &quot;a hurry-up, completer&quot; once and I think that fits me quite well. Getting on and doing is the best way to fight the crushing existential angst and fear that comes from having nothing to do or things being unresolved! (I consider thinking as a type of doing.)</p>
<p>That said, there is an optimum level of busyness where I&#039;m operating at the level of playing. I&#039;ve heard this said a few times over the years and recently too and I think playing gives the best results. Playing allows my subconscious to get to work, which I think is where the real problem solving gets done. However, most of this year has been operating at level of stress. Too many problems and not enough solutions and it&#039;s the opposite of fun and may be partly why my immune system finally cracked!</p>
<p>Many people I&#039;ve been around or spoken to recently have been feeling the same, only more so. Tough times for a lot of people and generally much more pressing than my little troubles.</p>
<p>I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll continue to get the opportunity to carry on getting paid-to-play after 2012, but I&#039;d like to. I&#039;m not ever likely to live a lavish material lifestyle following this path, but it&#039;s a pretty decent quality of life when you subtract all the background noise of politics, moaning, money troubles and personality clashes. The noise can be very loud at times!</p>
<p><strong>Art</strong></p>
<p>Honourable mention to <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/grayson_perry.aspx" target="_blank" title="http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/grayson_perry.aspx">Grayson Perry</a> and his exhibition at the British Museum. One of the best exhibitions I&#039;ve seen in years. His curation of objects from the collection alongside his own work and commentary are just brilliant. His thoughts on Art, Celebrity and the relationship of the Modern World with the Past really resonated with me. His eye for interesting objects and juxtaposition with his own work has such a light touch. I&#039;d never seen his work up close before and he really is a Master Craftsman himself. And as well as being really accessible and intelligent, best of all is how funny he is. One of those exhibitions where I came out thinking, &quot;Yeah, Art is pretty amazing at making me think and feel when it&#039;s done well. That guy is definitely an Artist&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Tablet</strong></p>
<p>Just a quick note to say, yes it does everything I want - and I&#039;ve rediscovered gaming! (Not a good thing) - however it&#039;s definitely one for people who like to tinker. Great value for money too, but if you want something to use without messing about and don&#039;t care about the specifications I wanted or walled-gardens and all that: Get an iPad! :-)<strong><br /></strong></p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Great review of Grayson Perry's exhibition. Do you mind if I quote it on Facebook to let friends know how good it is?
I entirely agree with you about the importance of play as an element in any job. It can lead to a more creative, relaxed, intuitive and curious, more exploratory state of mind which makes the job 'fun' and leads to new discoveries almost without trying. And it makes the day go quicker. The Swedes discovered (many years ago) that the most rounded citizens were those that had had a lot of free play when they were younger.
And speaking of 'play', I recommend 'The Mysteries of Lisbon'. It's 5 hours in the cinema but it's worth it. A story constructed very much like (Voltaire's) Candide.

<p><strong>Problem Solving</strong></p>
<p>It kept coming up, so I decided to finally draw up my generic problem solving algorithm as a diagram. If you want proper rigorous analysis then I suggest starting with <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Solve-Mathematical-Penguin-Science/dp/0140124993" target="_blank" title="How to Solve it">How to Solve It</a> by George Polya, but this diagram is my heuristic and contains what I call the Zeroth Rule: recognising there is a problem in the first place (aka &quot;Am I in denial?&quot;). Maybe someone will find it useful...</p>
<p><strong>Dawn Simulator</strong></p>
<p>...speaking of which, if you are like me and have (more than usual) trouble getting out of bed at this time of year, then why not make a dawn simulator?</p>
<p>&#160;All you need is a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Time-Guard-24hour-Digital-Timer/dp/B002K8I16U/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322768845&amp;sr=8-3" target="_blank">timer switch</a>, a <a href="http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/30029224/" target="_blank">lamp</a> and a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Daylight-White-Energy-Saving-Spiral/dp/B004V2Z058/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322768997&amp;sr=8-2" target="_blank">daylight frequency bulb.</a></p>
<p>Stick it away from your bed, so it doesn&#039;t shine right in your face when it comes on. Set the lamp to come on 30-20 minutes before your alarm goes off and hopefully it&#039;ll be a bit less awful when it does.</p>
<p>It may be placebo, but the science behind it is the fact that we have cells in our eyes that are sensitive to blue frequencies in daylight that regulate the hormones associated with waking up.</p>
<p><strong>Tablet Computer</strong></p>
<p>Next a bit of consumer information.</p>
<p>I&#039;ve been looking at tablet computers with the stipulation that it must be good for watching TV and Films, listening to music and potentially using as an e-reader - an entertainment device. I also decided that it should have a HDMI output so I can connect it to a TV to play movies, a USB connection for file transfers and have expandable storage with a slot for a flash card. And obviously it needs to be mobile. I don&#039;t need 3G.</p>
<p>This ruled out the Ipad for me, but I will give a nod to the fact it is reviewed and I agree from my playing with it, the most complete user experience. By this I mean that it&#039;s smooth and works without tweaks. However not the best screen, interestingly.</p>
<p>Having then looked at the Windows and Android options, I realised that I&#039;d need to wait for Windows 8 to come out to get a decent mobile computing experience. Windows 7 is not optimised well for this type of machine, so they got ruled out too. If you&#039;re buying next year, Windows 8 has good preview reports, so worth bearing in mind.</p>
<p>This left the Android machines. I narrowed it down to the Asus Eee Pad Transformer and the Motorola Xoom after ruling out the Samsung Galaxy Tab and Sony Tablet S as they didn&#039;t meet the requirements - no HDMI or standard USB. Which is a shame, as like the Ipad, they are much more elegant devices than the Xoom or Eee Pad.</p>
<p>In the end it came down to the screen and the price. The <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Motorola-Xoom-Android-Tablet-battery/dp/B004SG6BK0?SubscriptionId=AKIAJ7T5BOVUVRD2EFYQ&amp;tag=camelcamelcam-21&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=B004SG6BK0" target="_blank">Motorola Xoom</a> has the best screen (along with the Sony and Samsung) of all the tablets I&#039;ve played with, as well as being the cheapest. (This is because it&#039;s heavy at 730g and they&#039;ve just brought the lighter Xoom 2 out.)</p>
<p>I&#039;ve yet actually purchase one, but the Xoom is now at my price point of £300 and if anyone is interested I&#039;ll update you on what it&#039;s actually like to live with day to day.</p>
<p>I&#039;m going to use the other half of the money I put aside to replace my broken workstation with a new cheap workstation with the kind of power and proper functionality that the tablet won&#039;t have.</p>
<p><strong>PhD</strong></p>
<p>I&#039;ve got my offer through for my time at Microsoft Research Cambridge, so this means my thesis submission date will be December 2012. Just a year left and it&#039;s not a barrel of laughs at all. In fact I&#039;m completely fed up with it. Problems, problems and more problems. That&#039;s all I want to say.</p>
<p>Intellectually I know this is a privileged life I&#039;m leading, but emotionally I&#039;m not feeling it!</p>
<p>Hopefully I&#039;ll be over this hump by Christmas and then I can write a more descriptive post about what I&#039;m up to.</p>
<p>I hope everyone else is having a good end to the year - if you need a good read, I&#039;m loving <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dervish-House-Gollancz-S-F/dp/0575088621/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322771853&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">The Dervish House</a> by Ian MacDonald at the moment.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#160;</p>
<p><a href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/69a5c-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201543432c32e970c-120wi.jpg" style="display:inline;"><img alt="Books-web" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201543432c32e970c" src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/69a5c-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201543432c32e970c-120wi.jpg" title="Books-web" /></a> <br /><strong>&#160;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reading List</strong></p>
<p>I thought I&#039;d start with books this time. The picture shows the books I&#039;ve got in my &#039;still to read&#039; pile at the moment<strong>. </strong>I&#039;m lucky if I get through one book a month, so there&#039;s enough there to last me until May next year. I&#039;ve even stopped getting books from the library at the moment - much as I appreciate them, no more please.</p>
<p>My favourite reads from 2011 so far have both been non-fiction, unusually for me, and I can highly recommend them to you:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mistakes-Were-Made-but-Not/dp/1905177216/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1312298824&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Mistakes were made (but not by me) by Carol Tarvis and Elliot Aronson</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Supercooperators-Evolution-Altruism-Behaviour-Succeed/dp/1847673368/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1312298865&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Supercooperators by Martin Nowak</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;Both are popular science books, the first one being a Psychology book and the second a Maths book. What they both share is their attempt to explain why we behave the way we do and both have given me plenty of food for thought.</p>
<p>&#039;Mistakes were made...&#039; is all about self-justification and how people (including me of course) struggle to deal with choices and information that conflict with our self-image and our perceptions about reality. In other words: why we make mistakes and are so bad at facing up to them. This might sound like a depressing read! And certainly it&#039;s uncomfortable when one identifies with the examples given. But working from the principal that more information generally increases ones certainty about what to do, it gave me a lot to think about in how better to deal with my own mistakes (and in responding to other peoples) as well as about social policy.</p>
<p>&#039;Supercooperators&#039; is all about using the mathematics of Game Theory to explain the paradox of &#039;survival of the fittest&#039; as a principal underpinning our diverse natural world that is almost entirely based on cooperation. What I particularly like about the book is that it interweaves the authors story of becoming a scientist with the ideas themselves. It&#039;s an inspiring read too, showing the power of simple ideas to explain a range of observations from the small scales of cells to that of societies.</p>
<p>It immediately got me musing on the fact that people are less friendly in cities than in small communities. Following the ideas in the book, I reasoned that due to the lack of repeat encounters in a big city there is less incentive to be nice to someone in the street, as you are far more unlikely to see them again and have either the kindness or the rudeness repaid, than in a small community. Further in a city, your behaviour is less likely to be witnessed by people with who you interact and there is less risk to ones reputation by behaving badly.</p>
<p>I&#039;m presently reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Count-Monte-Cristo-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140449264/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1312300969&amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank">The Count of Monte Cristo</a>, a 1200 page tome that is something of a detective novel precursor, but also has something of the Cowboy genre to it.</p>
<p><strong>TV and Films</strong></p>
<p>Speaking of Cowboys, I&#039;ve been enjoying the latest series of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justified_%28TV_series%29" target="_blank">Justified</a>. Worth a look.</p>
<p>Probably the best thing I&#039;ve seen this year is <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Treme-Season-1-HBO-DVD/dp/B004KSRPB0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1312301347&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Treme</a>, after Neil gave me the DVD for my birthday. It&#039;s hard to describe as it&#039;s rather meandering as a narrative. However, it&#039;s a drama about the lives of people in New Orleans 6 months after Hurricane Katerina in 2006. The music is fantastic and as with everything by David Simon, it&#039;s funny and moving in turns.</p>
<p>I finally gave <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/beinghuman/" target="_blank">Being Human</a> a go and was pleasantly surprised. The set-up sounded appalling (Vampire, Ghost and Werewolf living together) and the narrative is a bit all over the place and it doesn&#039;t really work when it tries to be serious, but when it sticks to funny I thought it was very good.</p>
<p>Not much to shout about at the cinema this year. Perhaps the thing I enjoyed best was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0945513/" target="_blank">Source Code</a>. This was the film Inception wanted to be. A total B-movie, but so much the better for it.</p>
<p><strong>PhD</strong></p>
<p>When I last posted I was about to go to London to try and get my experiments to work - well that was a total failure!</p>
<p>I&#039;m coming into my last year and still have yet to get any experiments to work. The pressure is slowly starting to mount, but I remain at least mildly optimistic that I&#039;ll have something working by this time next year.</p>
<p>It would be pretty frustrating to get to the end without anything working in the real world, but I&#039;d be far from the first person to get a PhD without having got their experiments to work. I have a plan for the next few months and Tina did give me some good training at Birkbeck, so I&#039;ve been able to resurrect the machine in Southampton to continue the experiments here.</p>
<p>On the positive side, in the world of simulation I have one of the biggest computers in the UK to use and I&#039;m making good progress with this part of the work having initiated a collaboration with some colleagues from the Chemistry department. Watch this clip from the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-10859175" target="_blank">BBC</a> to check out our machine.</p>
<p>There is a certain irony that I&#039;m running out of time just when I feel I&#039;m starting to get a handle on the project after 3 years. There&#039;s masses to do if we are ever to nail down how our bodies process and present the information which our immune systems use to recognise disease. Although the money is rubbish, the quality of life is pretty good. I spoke to my supervisor about staying on after I finish and I&#039;m pleased to say he&#039;d be happy to keep me on. There is, however the small matter of funding my research and in this financial climate, money is pretty hard to come by. I&#039;m hopeful that a grant can be successfully applied for before my current funding runs out, but it&#039;s as least as likely as not that I&#039;ll be looking for a job come October 2012.</p>
<p><strong>Running</strong></p>
<p>I&#039;ve kind of lost my focus a bit since the Marathon and the PhD has become all consuming at times. It&#039;s the summer cross country season here at the moment and I&#039;m presently 14th in the table and I&#039;m happy with that.</p>
<p>I did get to run in the London 10k at the end of May as a club athlete. This was fun as I got to warm up with Paula Radcliffe, Jo Pavey and Mo Farah. Professional athletes like them are on another level, yet they were all so friendly to everyone. (The race itself was far too hot and I didn&#039;t really enjoy it all!)</p>
<p><strong>And the rest</strong></p>
<p>I feel like there should be more to say, but there really isn&#039;t. This is it. I&#039;m always slightly surprised to find that I&#039;m still here, but here I am.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/8fbba-6a00d8348a3d9b69e2014e610dee6c970c-120wi.jpg" style="display:inline;"><img alt="A_Paris" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e2014e610dee6c970c" src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/8fbba-6a00d8348a3d9b69e2014e610dee6c970c-120wi.jpg" title="A_Paris" /></a> <br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Running</strong></p>
<p>I completed my first marathon on a lovely spring morning in Paris on the 10th of April.</p>
<p>You can click on this link <a href="http://www.asochallenge.com/us/classement.html" target="_blank" title="Paris Marathon Results">Paris Marathon Results</a> and enter my bib number <strong>12819 </strong>in the number box to search for my result and see videos of me etc.</p>
<p>I&#039;ve never seen myself running before and I had this image of myself being smooth and graceful, rather than the wonky, slightly mincing style I actually have!</p>
<p>It was a surprise to me how much I enjoyed the marathon. I&#039;d expected I&#039;d enjoy Paris, but I expected the race iteslf would be hard and uncomfortable. In reality I was caught up in the atmosphere and ran round with a smile on my face all the way. They printed our names on our bib and the cheers of &#039;Allez Alistair&#039; and high-fives from spectating kids were particulary fun. There were supporters and bands and cheerleaders along the whole course as well as all the sites of Paris to see. I did find it a bit uncomfortable once I got past 20 miles, but I never felt like stopping or had any real pain. My strategy of walking 20 seconds through every mile marker seemed to work pretty well. As did my homemade sports drink. The only downside was getting a bit of heatstroke and having to sleep for 14 hours afterwards.</p>
<p>There is something kind of absurd about running 26.2 miles and I don&#039;t feel a tremendous urge to do it again, but I am thinking about another one for next year. Next up is the summer cross country season here and the BUPA 10k on the 30th of May in London...more of my absurd idea of fun.</p>
<p><strong>PhD and the rest</strong></p>
<p>I just need one decent set of data and then I&#039;ll have something to write a PhD dissertation about! Sadly this always seems just over the horizon.</p>
<p>I got a bit fed up a couple of months ago when it finally dawned on me that my supervisors don&#039;t have the expertise to guide me towards the goals they have set! Fortunately my principal supervisor is supportive of my delcared intention to go and get the expertise I need however I can. So I&#039;ve made contact with an experienced kineticist in London and will be up at UCL in May to try and do the experiments under her guidance.<strong>&#160;</strong></p>
<p>I&#039;m actually writing a short essay for one of my sponsors about doing science, so maybe I&#039;ll post that here when it&#039;s done.</p>
<p>Something that&#039;s come up a few times recently is what I shall call <strong>My Heuristics for Life</strong>. Or Rules of Thumb, if you prefer. It&#039;s a list I&#039;ve been compiling, deleting and editing for about ten years or so. It&#039;s been pointed out to me that it is similar and to the <a href="http://peterfox.com.au/manifesto_kopp.htm" target="_blank" title="http://peterfox.com.au/manifesto_kopp.htm">estascatological laundry list</a> of Sheldon Kopp. And I can&#039;t claim any great original thoughts, most of them are other peoples thoughts that struck me as worth remembering, but here&#039;s the current version for anyone else that might find it useful:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be kind. This is entirely practical. There’s not much to be gained by being mean, but there is a lot to lose.</li>
<li>If you are not for yourself, who is? If you do not look after yourself how can you be of use to anyone else? </li>
<li>Blaming yourself or other people when things go wrong is essentially a useless activity. </li>
<li>If you do the same old things, the same old things keep happening.</li>
<li>Don’t agonise over decisions too much. Whatever you decide, chances are you will end up convincing yourself you made the right choice – even if in fact it was the wrong one!</li>
<li>Perhaps the only useful question when considering the past is: What could I do differently next time?</li>
<li>Generally people are very bad at learning from their mistakes. You only have to be moderately good at learning from your mistakes to be above average!</li>
<li>You tend to find in a place what you bring to it. </li>
<li>Fortune favours the prepared mind. (Louis Pasteur)</li>
<li>Focus on what you can do. Don’t linger on things you can’t control.</li>
<li>If I’m in a bad mood there’s a good chance I need to eat something.</li>
<li>You can have quick or easy, but rarely both at the same time.</li>
<li>What is a journey of a thousand miles, but many small steps repeated? &#160;Big changes are often the sum of many small ones.</li>
<li>When faced with a problem you don’t know how to solve, just try anything new. (But maybe be conservative in what you try!) Chances are it will be wrong, but the new information it yields will be useful for the next iteration.</li>
<li>If you want to be good at anything, it takes practice. And at least 6 months to form or break a habit. Remember this when the initial enthusiasm for something new starts to wear off!</li>
<li>You can do one thing well or many things badly.</li>
<li>However much data you have it’s never enough, but intuition fails more often than not, so in data we trust. If something feels intuitively right, take a moment to look at the data, cos your intuition is probably wrong!</li>
<li>That said, there is no substitute for experience.</li>
<li>What one fool can do, another can. (Richard Feynman)</li>
<li>There’s never a good time to make a change or take a break. If not now, then when?</li>
<li>Being an adult is difficult, but it’s better than being a child.</li>
<li>If you’re not doing it for fun or for money, why are you doing it?</li>
</ol><ol> </ol>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Science</strong></p>
<p>Having trudged through the snow in my running spikes to the hospital, I looked at my lab book on Friday the 3rd of December after I took the readings that confirmed that I&#039;d finally got a working experiment to note that I had first attempted it on the 28th of January 2010. Apparently this is not an especially long time to take.</p>
<p>Earlier that week I&#039;d commented that what I most wanted for Christmas was a working protein refold and this was what I got. Happy days! I should point out that making protein is only the first step. Protein is the raw materials I need for the experiments proper that I need to do to actually do some novel science, which is what I hope to do in 2011.</p>
<p>Back-tracking a moment: We&#039;re trying to understand one of the processes by which our bodies know when we are ill. The strategy (part of the wider project) I&#039;m pursuing is one where we isolate as much as possible individual components of the larger system so we can control and observe their interaction when we put components together. Making these components, these proteins is a tricky business.</p>
<p>What we do is first isolate the DNA from which the protein is made into a molecule called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid" target="_blank" title="Plasmid">plasmid</a> (another problem in itself) and then insert this into bacteria (in our scenario) and trick the bacteria into growing and making lots more bacteria, each making lots of the (human) protein using its own protein production machinery. We then kill all the bacteria, split them open and harvest the protein and purify it. The whole process takes one to two weeks. The protein is then like a big tangle of spaghetti and we have to tackle the hardest part of the process, refolding the protein into its natural structure.</p>
<p>Structure and function are intimately related, for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickle_cell" target="_blank" title="Sickle Cell">sickle cell anaemia</a> where suffers lose function of their red blood cells is caused by a single mutation in one of the amino acids that changes the shape of their haemoglobin protein.</p>
<p>I want to look at the behaviour of a human protein complex (complex because it actually comprises of three separate proteins that are bound together) called <a href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/static.do?p=education_discussion/molecule_of_the_month/pdb62_1.html" target="_blank" title="Major Histocompatibility Complex">MHC</a> Class I molecules. These proteins are the flags on the surface of our cells that indicate the health status of our cells.</p>
<p>In our bodies, nature has evolved all sorts of mechanisms using proteins to ensure they fold correctly, although it is far from perfect, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloidosis" target="_blank" title="Amyloidosis">Amyloidosis</a> being an example of misfolding of proteins that contributes to many diseases such as Alzheimer&#039;s and kidney failure.</p>
<p>So in the laboratory, in solution rather than in a cell, it&#039;s a matter of biochemistry to try and fold the spaghetti tangle of protein we&#039;ve expressed from DNA in bacteria. And that&#039;s the problem I&#039;ve been spending much of this year and certainly almost the whole of the last three months trying to acheive. Thankfully I&#039;ve got it to fold - I don&#039;t know why it&#039;s worked this time, this will be a matter for further investigation - but now I&#039;ve got it, I can start doing experiments to understand the MHC Class I molecules behaviour and maybe move the knowledge forward a tiny little bit.</p>
<p>I&#039;d never used a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_displacement_pipette" target="_blank" title="Pippette">Gilson pipette</a> before January and my left thumb now has calloused skin on the top from time spent using one, while my right thumb is likewise calloused from opening and closing <a href="http://www.eppendorf.com/int/index.php?pb=a28d296de52bdc8c&amp;action=products&amp;contentid=1&amp;catalognode=9793" target="_blank" title="Eppendorf">eppendorf tubes</a>. So even my body is starting to resemble that of a laboratory biologist.</p>
<p>I&#039;m just past half-way in the time I have allocated for my PhD. The deadline (academically and financially) is October 2012, so 2011 is likely to be a busy year in which, with luck, I will gather lots of useful data with which to produce some kind of thesis report with. My thesis being something to do with how another protein called Tapasin influences the binding of small proteins to MHC Class I molecules which ultimately determine the immune response.</p>
<p><strong>Running</strong></p>
<p>After a long recovery period, I&#039;m slowly getting my fitness back.Which is a great feeling.</p>
<p>I was re-reading part of one of my favourite books, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lore-Running-Tim-Noakes/dp/0873229592/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1292173876&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank" title="Lore of Running">The Lore of Running</a> where he reflects about what running has taught him about life and I was not entirely surprised to be reminded how many of these reflections I share: the need for solitude, humility, the importance of play, it&#039;s role in creative thought and the lessons in honesty, as he says: <em>&quot;There is...no luck in running. Results cannot be faked and there is no-one but yourself to blame when things go wrong.&quot;</em> But the thing that struck me that I&#039;d never really thought of as a postive attributes before are the roles of insecurity and failure. He comments that, <em>&quot;...it is in our inevitable failures that the seeds of real personal growth are sown and eventually blossom.&quot; </em>And I think that has certainly been true for me so far and that in running (like any worthwhile activity) through the highs and lows, fears and doubts, successes and failures, it teaches me about myself, my limits and my place in the world.<strong>&#160;</strong></p>
<p>Anyhow enough of the existential angst...Entirely against my usual philosophy that it is the thing itself that matters, not <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-10965608" target="_blank" title="Rise of the Mamils">ego trips</a>, I&#039;ve signed up for Paris Marathon next spring and the London Triathlon next summer. So if you see me hobbling down the street next year, feel free to quote Tim Noakes comments about only having myself to blame back at me...</p>
<p><strong>And the rest...</strong></p>
<p>It&#039;s been so long since I wrote and it&#039;s all a blur...I had a holiday to Germany with Phil, Jen and Thea in August. Which was great, although the weather wasn&#039;t terribly kind to us. I&#039;d reccomend it to anyone. The bread was a revelation. The Spa&#039;s were brilliant. Beautiful scenary in the Black Forest and cool Cities. I should sort out the few photos I took and post them...</p>
<p>Then I did my best man duties at Neil and Laura&#039;s Wedding, which all went off without a hitch largely thanks to Laura&#039;s hard work and meticulous planning.</p>
<p>Not read too many books or seen much in the way of TV or Films worth mentioning. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Quiet-War-Gollancz-Paul-McAuley/dp/0575083557/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1292176539&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" title="The Quiet War">The Quiet War</a> which I read on holiday is perhaps my best read of the year.</p>
<p>Oh and I made my own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_simulation" target="_blank" title="Dawn Simulation">Dawn Simulator</a> using a timer switch and cheap Ikea lamp with a Daylight frequency bulb. It may been entirely psychological, but for someone who hates getting up, especially at this time of year, it definitely helps.</p>
<p>It&#039;s been a pretty tough year I&#039;d say - but then aren&#039;t they all - but I&#039;m finishing in a good position for the next steps. What&#039;s that saying? <em>Sometimes you eat the bear and sometimes it eats you</em>. Right now we&#039;re about even.</p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[A very positive blog. A little bit of success makes a world of difference! Worth the wait? Last time we spoke you were quite despondent about carrying on. What a change!
So I was surprised when you said 'enough of the existential angst'. I thought your paragraph on the Lore of Running was equally positive - "...it is in our inevitable failures that the seeds of real personal growth are sown and eventually blossom."
And I liked the idea of the Dawn Simulator too. (A bit like the joke where the man changes his brown curtains for blue ones.)
Good that things appear, after a long time, to be looking up for you. Hope that carries on.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[That was quite an inspirational read for me. The thought of someone taking so much trouble to work out solutions to health problems that may affect me one day has never really occurred to me. It is more real as I can visualise the complex, intricate process and the tenacity! Best wishes for the progress next year and the running ambitions.I look forward to seeing the photos.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/f180e-6a00d8348a3d9b69e20133f319f605970b-120wi.jpg" style="display:inline;"><img alt="Duathlon_Sunset_280710" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e20133f319f605970b " src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/f180e-6a00d8348a3d9b69e20133f319f605970b-120wi.jpg" title="Duathlon_Sunset_280710" /></a></p><p style="text-align:justify;">All I can do is what I can do - I can&#039;t remember if I read it or somebody said it, but it feels like my 2010 mantra.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sport</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Starting with what matters most to me! ;-)</p><p style="text-align:justify;">I began a new running programme in January and it was all going really well. My times were coming down and I got a new personal best over 10km of 36 min 50s in March. Then a couple of weeks later I got my first serious sports injury and had to stop running&#160; altogether for 6 weeks and I was walking with a limp for a while.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">I damaged a tendon in my right foot, probably a mixture of doing too much, wearing the wrong shoes and ignoring the warning signs and trying to run through it. It was probably the first time I&#039;ve not run for that long in over 10 years and I didn&#039;t take it very well. My big running book cites a study detailing how runners develop an emotional and physical attachment to the sport and to not be able to do it is unthinkable. Well, that is certainly how I found it - unthinkable and unbearable until I finally resigned myself to it. It ruined my chance to improve my position in the summer cross country league as I missed most of the races and I&#039;m only now just starting to reach the point where I can train hard again.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Luckily I know a physiotherapist through the School of Medicine and along with her podiatrist colleague I got great advice and support for free - well, the quid pro quo was being a control in some of their experiments researching rheumatoid arthritis, but that was actually good fun.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The silver lining came through my running club. Quite a few of my colleagues are into Triathlons and they took me out swimming and cycling while I couldn&#039;t run. I bought a wet suit and dug my old road bike out of the garage. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Swimming in the sea here has been a revelation. I&#039;d forgotten how great it is and I&#039;ve been in most weeks since May. You have to drive half an hour to reach the sea from Southampton, but it&#039;s fantastic. I did only last 10 minutes in May and my hands were blue when I came out, but I&#039;ve been able to dump the wetsuit recently.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Cycling too has shown me so much more of the surrounding area. The picture above is from a ride out to the New Forest in July. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever love cycling or swimming as much as running, but I&#039;m definitely going to do more cross training from now on and I&#039;m thinking about the London Triathlon for next year.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Most recently, I&#039;ve been offered a place to do the New York marathon in November as part of the Cancer Research UK staff team. I&#039;ve never run a marathon - 20 miles is as far as I go in training - but it&#039;s a tempting offer if I can get fit in time.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Also, I decided to have laser eye correction a few weeks ago too which is going to make sports so much better. I had most of the money from selling my big motorbike sitting around for two years and had still not spent it due to my inability to think of anything I really want or need. (I have enough running shoes.) So I now have 20/20 vision and won&#039;t need contact lenses for sport ever again, which is life changing in a small but important way.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>PhD</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Last Thursday after 6 long weeks, 29,000 words and 133 pages, I handed in my report for my transfer thesis. I will be exactly two years and half way into my time in October and now is the point where I transfer to properly be doing a PhD. (I spent the whole of July without drinking alcohol in a vain hope it would help me get the report done!)</p><p style="text-align:justify;">To be blunt - it&#039;s not going very well. I put in a lot of time, but I have no real results to show for it and feel so out of my depth most of the time, it&#039;s not funny. This is one reason I was running so much and led to getting injured - to cope with the stress.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">My supervisors seem to think it will all come good, so I try and hold onto that reassurance, but it&#039;s tough to believe it.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Since January I&#039;ve been in the laboratory at the hospital. We are soon to relocate to our new home in the shiny new <a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/ifls/about_us/lsb.html" target="_blank">Life Sciences building</a>. I&#039;ve been trying to perform experiments to evaluate whether our model of how our cells tell our immune system whether they are healthy or have diseases inside them is correct. I do this by working with the proteins that exist in our cells. They have been isolated and produced in solution, what we call <em>in vitro</em>.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">However, as I&#039;m discovering, most experiments don&#039;t work. Getting a working experiment is a real battle, taking months of work, if not years.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In one sense it is a nice quality of life - getting paid to find new stuff out. But ultimately it&#039;s a results business, so no-ones going to give me a job if I don&#039;t deliver in the end. And I&#039;m aware that the money for what I do comes from people doing things like sponsored runs etc. and so it&#039;s not much good if we don&#039;t actually push the knowledge forward towards treating cancer better.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In terms of my particular project - and I&#039;ve only myself to blame for agreeing to this, lest it sounds like self-pity - the problem is trying to master three disciplines of which I have no experience: Cancer Science, Structural Biology and Computational Science.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">So like I say - All I can do is what I can do. Here&#039;s a quote from my colleague Neil which neatly sums up the situation and is the kind of thing I try to remember when I feel that rising sense of panic about it all:</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;color:#1f497d;">`I totally understand your concerns, I think that
much of it derives from you being “at that part of your PhD” where you are
sufficiently familiar with what people have done previously, but figured out
how difficult it is to do original research, and now concerned that you have to
get the majority of the results that will go in your final thesis within a
year!&#160; Rest assured, this is entirely normal.&#039;</span></em></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;color:#111111;"><strong>And the rest...</strong></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;color:#111111;">Last week I made the decision to sell my house in London, so if anyone wants to live in East London, do get in touch!</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;color:#111111;">My tenants are moving out and I find it hard to imagine ever going back there, even if I moved back to London, so it seemed like a good time to try and sell. I&#039;ve been trying to simplify my life a bit further this year - so far it&#039;s been a horrible year emotionally to be honest and having one less thing to worry about would be good.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;color:#111111;">At this point I&#039;ve no idea what happens when October 2012 rolls around, but I want to be as flexible as possible. Right now I just want to go to sleep for a long long time, maybe forever. <br /></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:&quot;color:#111111;">I&#039;m off to Germany at the end of the week for some camping, so a break at last and hopefully I&#039;ll come back refreshed. Just been picking out my holiday reading for the trip.

It&#039;s not exactly deep, but it&#039;s entertaining enough.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The best film I&#039;ve seen this year are, belatedly, is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386117/" target="_blank">Where the Wild Things Are</a>. It really captured for me what it feels like to be a child. Be interested to know what a child would make of it though.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">I really like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1235166/" target="_blank">A Prophet</a> too. This follows the incarceration of a young man in France and his rise in the criminal ranks.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">So I&#039;m sure there is lots of stuff I&#039;ve forgotten that may be of interest to someone from the last 6 months, but it feels like it&#039;s been one long week since I updated this blog such is the intensity!</p><p style="text-align:justify;"></p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Al,
Thanks for the update. Quite a tumultuous time you are are having.?? Savour it ... relish it.... you have so much knowledge of life and living that you are passing on through this blog. To be quite honest with you my thoughts are. and it is purely my thoughts...I don't give a f"£! whether you get the PHD or not. It is clear how much effort and work and sweat you are putting into this. That I believe, and again I emphasise my opinion only is worth more than the letters PHD. Of course I hope you do get it though ;))
Best of Luck Alistair. Have no doubts.....
I hope we can sit and have a beer soon some time.

I happened to be there when they were taking publicity shots for Cancer Research UK, so I asked for a copy. That look on my face is me trying not to mess up (again). Andy the guy mentoring me is in the background.</p><p>The second one is from the last race I ran back in November (not sure it&#039;s possible to look good when running) - the weather has led to three races I&#039;d have run since then being cancelled. I&#039;m still trying to decide what my goals are for 2010. More on running later.</p><p>So I&#039;ve been in the lab since the 18th of January. I&#039;m absolutely exhausted. It&#039;s a whole other world of jargon, protocols and etiquette that I&#039;m having to absorb. I put my foot in it the other day by remarking about how slow progress was! Andy thinks we&#039;re going really quickly and he should know. I have nothing to judge it against. Actually doing experiments is fairly manual and repetitive. I was mulling when I was watching a really bored barista make my coffee the other day, how similar what we were doing was. </p><p>What is good about lab stuff is that it&#039;s more tangible than computer/maths stuff. What&#039;s bad is that there is no &#039;Undo&#039; button, mess it up and it&#039;s start again. Which is kinda tense after 7 hours of work and knowing that one mistake would mean it&#039;s all wasted. And the experiment dictates my day. There&#039;s no pausing for coffee whenever I feel like it, I go when it lets me - and there&#039;s no drinking coffee while I&#039;m in the lab.</p><p>The point of these experiments is to try and evaluate if the real proteins behave like the pretend ones in our models. Which in turn is trying to understand how our cells tell our immune system if they have cancer (or other diseases.)Testing this is incredibly difficult. After three weeks we&#039;re still establishing how to do the actual experiments we need. It&#039;s lots of pipetting, centrifuges, mixing liquids and measuring things. I am learning a lot of stuff.</p><p>Something that is very familiar is the politics of work places - same old, same old. It&#039;s hard enough learning all the technical stuff, but then add in the effort required to understand the various tensions and rivalries and layers of resentment and general bitching and moaning that goes on and that&#039;s why I&#039;m so tired. I&#039;m feeling quite sick and tired of people to be honest! Moving on...</p><p>Props to Katherine for bringing <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Born-Run-Ultra-running-Super-athlete-Tribe/dp/1861978235/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1266093097&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Born to Run</a> to my attention. Sure, he takes a few artistic liberties to tell the story, but this is a great non-fiction book about running - as a pastime, as an industry and as part of human history. A real page turner. Even if you aren&#039;t a runner I think most people would enjoy it. </p><p>As I was reading it, Daniel Lieberman&#039;s latest paper on barefoot running got on the cover of Nature - he&#039;s also in Born to Run - enjoy the video summary <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jrnj-7YKZE" target="_blank">here</a>. I&#039;ve long been suspicious of&#160; sports shoes as a cause of injury and the case for barefoot running has been around for a couple of decades. It seems like we&#039;re getting closer to proper evidence, so I&#039;ve made the switch to minimalist running - that is virtually barefoot, just a 1mm of rubber beneath my feet and the ground in my <a href="http://www.feelmax.fi/index.php" target="_blank">Feelmax</a>. It&#039;s been a revelation, like I&#039;m learning to run again, but learning to run properly. I&#039;m having to ease my way in so that I don&#039;t end up with stress fractures, but once my muscles have adapted to take the load, I&#039;m hopeful this is the way to faster pain free running for decades to come.</p><p>The only novel I finished since I last wrote was <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Breath-Tim-Winton/dp/0330455729/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1266094459&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Breath</a> by Tim Winton. I&#039;m not sure about this book. The description of the exhilaration of surfing was second to none from what I remember of it myself. I can&#039;t put my finger on why I felt unsatisfied by the rest of the story about teenage boys growing up in Australia, but it didn&#039;t quite work for me. That said, I read it in a few days, so I was pulled along.</p><p>Neil got me James Ellroy&#039;s latest book for Christmas and I&#039;m working my way through that tome at the moment.</p><p>At the cinema I&#039;ve enjoyed <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/jan/14/up-in-the-air-review" target="_blank">Up in the Air</a> recently. Gorgeous George puts in a fine performance in a film about attachments and expectations. Funny, but not too sweet.</p><p>On TV, I&#039;ve finished Season 2 of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad" target="_blank">Breaking Bad</a> - definitely my favourite programme of the last 12 months. I see it&#039;s getting more attention now, so watch it before the hype really gets going.</p><p>I&#039;ve caught up with Mad Men and am watching the latest series. Can&#039;t help feeling it&#039;s mostly just a period drama for people who don&#039;t like bonnets and bustles, but it does have some great lines and tries to make a few social observations/contrasts.</p><p>Music wise I&#039;ve been enjoying the latest <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_5?url=search-alias%3Ddigital-music&amp;field-keywords=spoon+transference&amp;sprefix=spoon" target="_blank">Spoon</a> album - they&#039;ve gone for a stripped down guitar and drums sound this time. And the latest from <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_2_6?url=search-alias%3Ddigital-music&amp;field-keywords=four+tet+there+is+love+in+you&amp;sprefix=four+t" target="_blank">Four Tet</a> is rather lovely electronica.</p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Don't worry us about messing up in the lab: that's the sort of thing newspaper headlines are made of!
Yeah you do look good running - like a proper runner!
Bit worried about the 1mm soles on your running shoes - stones, broken glass, etc!?
My friend Tony also highly recommends Born To Run: think Jen might like it for her birthday.
I can recommend Ponyo (Studio Ghibli) as a film: a lovely film - the animation is beautiful; took Thea and her friend to see it over half term holiday, they loved it. (Yes, Thea in a cinema!!) The only jarring moment is when some horrible Teeny-bop pop music plays over the end credits so run out as soon as the film's over.
Pity about office politics - you'd think scientists would be more logical about it but there you go.
It's always good to do something practical; satisfying; there's pleasure in honing a skill or perfecting a craft (I miss darkroom photography and film cameras).
Good blog Al. Must see you soon.
Phil

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/2c37f-6a00d8348a3d9b69e20120a764808a970b-120wi.jpg" style="display:inline;"><img alt="GreenTree" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e20120a764808a970b " src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/2c37f-6a00d8348a3d9b69e20120a764808a970b-120wi.jpg" /></a> </p><p>It&#039;s the end of the working year for me. I realised that since I started in October 2008, I&#039;ve only had one full week when I did no PhD work at all. That was when I went to Corsica in the summer. So I&#039;m not going into the University for just over two weeks, but considering I mostly work from home anyway, how much I&#039;ll resist the constant worry that I should be doing more I don&#039;t know...</p><p>2009 has been a roller-coaster, that&#039;s for sure. Tim said to me at the outset of this journey it&#039;s all about what level of uncertainty one enjoys in life as to whether I&#039;ll enjoy research science. So depending on the day and my mood it can be inspiring in the way exciting mysteries are or it can induce the most depressing feeling of powerlessness and hopelessness. And all other colours of emotion in between.</p><p>Here&#039;s the story so far...</p><p>There have been long standing efforts to try and understand how our cells, that comprise our bodies communicate to the cells that guard against disease - collectively known as our immune system - whether they are healthy or unhealthy.</p><p>Unhealthy cells are those that have been compromised by pathogens (bacteria, viruses, parasites) or, like cancer cells, not properly formed cells. The immune system kills them once they&#039;ve been identified.</p><p>As an aside, it interests me to realise that the only human cells that ever get to have descendants are the sperm in men and eggs in women that fuse to make a new human. All other cells sacrifice themselves to ensure that this is possible. So cancer cells are rebels in that sense, they seek to reproduce independently and not be sacrificed in the greater cause like all the rest. Unfortunately, what they can&#039;t know, is that in their struggle to survive they will eventually kill their host and thus themselves.</p><p>Back to the research: in trying to understand how this cellular surveillance happens we&#039;re looking at the molecules (proteins) involved in the pathway of communication between our regular cells and immune system cells.</p><p>The first few months of my PhD were focused on the structures of two of the proteins and trying to figure out molecular/atomic level interactions using computer modelling. Experimental evaluation of this part will hopefully occur in 2010.</p><p>Since the summer, I&#039;ve moved on to trying to model mathematically a system of proteins we think are critical to deciding what information our cells present . This has been more than a bit challenging for me! I&#039;ve still a lot to do with this to have working models - I mostly have a stack of equations which need to be implemented. The point of this is to try and draw out mechanisms and understand how decisions are made about what information is presented and then make predictions that can be evaluated using real proteins. </p><p>It may not be immediately obvious how useful this is - but if one imagines be able to predict whether an immune system cell identifies a cancer cell correctly on the basis of flipping a particular switch inside the cancer cell so it sends a message to the surface flagging up its status, then maybe the power of an accurate equation becomes more apparent. Do X, observe Y. Of course it ain&#039;t that simple, but hopefully you get the idea...</p><p>Next and perhaps most interesting is that in the New Year I&#039;m going to do some laboratory experiments with the proteins themselves. Finally after all this fake science, I&#039;m going to do some honest lab coat wearing, pouring potions type of science. This is partly to help me understand how to improve the models, partly to improve my biology and most importantly to try and answer other questions raised by the models.</p><p>The whole basis of my PhD is that it is interdisciplinary and managing Computer Science, Structural Biology and Immunology was always going to be one of principle challenges. It was also a big selling point to me. So I&#039;ve done some structural stuff, some computer maths stuff and now I&#039;m going to do some hands-on immunology. Not sure how long that&#039;ll take, after which the focus will move back to one of the other aspects, but I&#039;m looking forward to a change of scene. And if you see on the News that Southampton General Hospital has burnt down - that&#039;ll be my fault.</p><p>That&#039;s where I&#039;m at after 14 months, with up to 34 to go. I&#039;d like to say I know something really useful that will help treat cancer, but mostly I just realise how much I don&#039;t know and how much there is to learn. Like I say, it&#039;s a stern lesson in learning to live with uncertainty.I&#039;ve maybe had two points in this time where I&#039;ve seriously thought about quitting, but I&#039;ve been reassured that whatever I felt in the first year, the second and third will be much worse!</p><p>I&#039;ve ended my running year well though. I did my first half-marathon in November and clocked a time of 1hr 24min 48sec, which I was pleased with. I placed 110th overall and 66th in my category out of 1200 runners. It was a race that had everything: Started in the sun, then came a howling gale and a downpour. We had to run through twenty metres of water, half a metre deep - twice. And then the sun came back out at the end. A guy from Winchester Running Club took a picture of me from the middle of the race, but it&#039;s not the most flattering image, so I decided not to post it!</p><p>My next race is not until January and I have to say running in the dark and the snow is not the best fun, so I&#039;ve eased up a bit at the moment.</p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Books, TV, Films and Music</span></p><p>I&#039;ve read a few too many post-apocalyptic novels this year. The latest one being <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0747585164/theidependent-21" target="_blank">Margaret Atwood&#039;s The Year of the Flood</a>. A follow up to Oryx and Crake. It&#039;s good, but I did feel it undercut the original a bit.</p><p>One of the best things I&#039;ve read this year is <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099502429/theidependent-21" target="_blank">You are Here by Christopher Potter</a>. Ostensibly a guide to the Universe in terms of science, he goes into the whole human condition and how we conceptualise the idea of the Universe and our place in it. My kind of guy - he repeatedly uses David Mermin&#039;s remark, &quot;Shut Up and Calculate!&quot; - to underline how science runs smack into philosophy and what a mess this becomes once we are forced to consider the meaning of the data we collect.</p><p>On TV I&#039;ve been enjoying <strong>True Blood, The Thick of It </strong>and most of all <a href="http://www.five.tv/programmes/drama/breaking-bad" target="_blank">Breaking Bad</a>. The vampire thing has been overdone, but True Blood is sufficiently entertaining and sophisticated to keep me watching. The Thick of It I enjoy simply for the pleasure of imaginative swearing. While Breaking Bad takes a really dark concept - a guy with lung cancer - makes it really funny and uses it to explore relationships and mortality in an excellent way.</p><p>Film wise, I really liked <strong>35 Shots of Rum</strong>. I saw it on DVD and watched it in two parts cos it was making me feel really miserable - what a recommendation! - but I&#039;d really like to see it again at the Cinema. It&#039;s unusual to see a film like this these days. One that tells the story mostly in pictures, without much dialogue and no voice over. A proper film! I read a review comparing it to Ozu and I can see exactly what they mean. A terribly intimate story of familial and ext
ended familial relationships in Paris. Certainly one of my favourites of the year. Soundtrack by the Tindersticks!</p><p><strong>Up</strong> was excellent too, which I did see at the cinema. I needed a feel good film at the time and this did the trick nicely. Dogs, Kids, A Grumpy Old Man and Balloons. What&#039;s not to like?</p><p><strong>The Bicycle Thieves</strong>. I&#039;ve been meaning to watch this for years. Amazing film. It really feels like its made by people unafraid to do anything but explore the medium and story they want to tell. No compromise for trying to capture a market that ruins so much modern film making and in so doing has produced some great cinematography that are now classic images, as well as being a social document of post-war Italy.It was incredibly sad though and I thought it was going to make me feel better after a rubbish day and instead it made me feel miserable!</p><p>The only new music I&#039;ve enjoyed recently was <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002DESIE6/theidependent-21" target="_blank">The XX</a> - pretty derivative and badly made music, but this still managed get under my skin. And <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dInnbQrYVhQ" target="_blank">Everything Hits at Once by Spoon</a> has been my track of the Autumn</p><p>I&#039;ve not taken any decent photos in ages, so the image above is one of my lino print Christmas cards from this year. I enjoyed making them enough that I&#039;m considering doing a print making course in the New Year.</p><p>And on that note, I&#039;ll sign off.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

<p></p><h4><strong>All about my summer:</strong></h4>
<p>It probably doesn&#039;t reflect well on me, but looking back over my summer the thing I feel most strongly about is running. It&#039;s sort of crept up on me over the years - something in life I can rely on even when everything else has gone to hell. If I could do science as a hobby and running as a job I think I&#039;d prefer that. This in the knowledge that most people think running is an odd thing to do at best.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I ran the summer cross country <a href="http://www.rr10.hampshire.org.uk/" target="_blank">RR10</a> league here for the first time and while competition is not my prime motivation for running, it has made me better. I finished 22nd in the league overall out of ~200 in the 10 races over the last four months. The women&#039;s team for my club won the league too. Today I ran a <a href="http://www.hursley10k.co.uk/index.html" target="_blank">10k</a> as a preparation for the winter season and went round in 38m14s, coming 5th out of ~500 mostly fun runners. It is satisfying to finish highly, but for perspective, the fastest guy was round in 35 minutes and world class is about 26 minutes!</p>
<p>I&#039;ve been helping another club member train for her first marathon and that&#039;s been interesting too, running with another person and exploring new routes and going further than I would normally in my training. The world really does seem like a different place on foot and takes me to places I&#039;ve not seen around the city. I was a bit worried about running with someone, rather than alone, thinking it might spoil the experience, but while it is different, it&#039;s actually been good fun and motivating, pushing the runs up to 20 miles over the summer. Though I still don&#039;t feel inclined to run a marathon myself! I have signed up for a half-marathon in November just to try that distance as a race.</p>
<p>Other than running, most of my summer has been spent studying. I finished my part the project I started back in November last year and spent most of August writing up. I ended up with a 17,000 word report! My supervisor Tim gave me some nice feedback last week, so although the slope is still just as steep going forward, I feel like I am actually going in the right direction. This part of the project was all about identifying a mechanism in our cells that influences how our immune systems see whether the cell is infected or part of a tumour. My colleague Andy is now doing some experiments with real cells to see if my models are in any way accurate. We should know around Christmas and in an ideal world the lab experiments validate the model and we&#039;ve done some science - a small step in the long journey.</p>

</p>
<p>As I commence my second year then I&#039;m looking at another aspect of modelling this phenomena of antigen presentation I just described in a bid to refine things even further. The more detailed the question, the harder it is to get a precise answer, but if we are ever going to develop therapies that take advantage of the power of our immune systems to fight cancer, we need precise answers. The reason we get side effects (or worse toxic effects) from drugs is exactly because the resolution of our knowledge is coarse. </p><p>Rationally, I always know I&#039;m a lucky boy to be doing what I&#039;m doing. Emotionally, it&#039;s hard to stay motivated faced with the difficulty of the problems and volume of information that has to be understood to even figure out what is the right question to ask. Science is not about faith, but much of the time that is exactly was is needed to get through the day. Faith that if I just keep going, keep chipping away, things will eventually get clearer. It often feels much more masochistic than even the hardest run though.</p><p class="asset asset-image"><a href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/d78b7-6a00d8348a3d9b69e20120a5a0c1c8970b-120wi.jpg" style="display:inline;"><img alt="Corte-Sunset-Web" class="at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e20120a5a0c1c8970b " src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/d78b7-6a00d8348a3d9b69e20120a5a0c1c8970b-120wi.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>I did have time for a couple of camping trips during the summer. A week in Corsica where the temperature wasn&#039;t below 30 all week during the day. Those small pleasures such as seeing the stars - seeing the Milky Way! - or swimming in the sea - seeing fish - or in a mountain river, while in the company of friends is what makes it a holiday. And I ate enough pizza to put me off pizza for some weeks. Something I didn&#039;t think was possible.</p><p class="asset asset-image"><a href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/fdf45-6a00d8348a3d9b69e20120a5a0c224970b-120wi.jpg" style="display:inline;"><img alt="System-19-Web" class="at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e20120a5a0c224970b " src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/fdf45-6a00d8348a3d9b69e20120a5a0c224970b-120wi.jpg" /></a>

<p>We had a short trip down in West Wittering at the beginning of September, which is a beautiful beach if you&#039;ve not been. The visit to the <a href="http://www.sculpture.org.uk/" target="_blank">CASS Sculpture Park</a> in Goodwood was a highlight too and I&#039;ve been telling everyone I&#039;ve seen since to visit! Pictures from both trips in the scrapbook and above.</p><p></p><h4><strong>Films, Books and TV:</strong></h4><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Highlights from the summer books wise:</span></p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1841496650/theidependent-21">Halting State by Charles Stross</a> - I originally bought this for my brother for his birthday, but he loaned it back to me. A funny tale of game playing and crime, yet convincing at the same time as a vision of our increasingly augmented reality. How long before we really do have GUI&#039;s overlaid onto the real world as we walk about? I particularly laughed at the idea of getting onto a bus to see icons blinking over the heads of kids with ASBO&#039;s so one knows where not to sit.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0575084588/theidependent-21">Lavinia by Ursula Le Guin</a> - another masterpiece from one of the best living writers imo. An imagining of the life of a character in prehistoric Italy from Virgil&#039;s Aeneid. Moving, exciting and always so much to think about afterwards. She really knows how to unpack a story so that I have to keep reading.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140455108/theidependent-21" target="_blank">Candide by Voltaire</a> - a birthday present from Phil. A short and fast paced book, but so dense with ideas and jokes that I&#039;ll probably have to re-read it sometime to get things I missed first time out. Quite horrible and yet much of it is still sadly relevant to how humans treat one another.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0753826607/theidependent-21" target="_blank">The Turnaround by George Pelecanos</a> - my favourite of his for some time. A smaller story than of late about Washington and more subtle and satisfying as a result.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0575084081/theidependent-21">Cyberabad Days by Ian MacDonald</a> - a collection of short stories set in a future India.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0330447548/theidependent-21" target="_blank">The Road by Cormac MacCarthy</a> - this has been recommended to me a couple of times and I wanted to see it before the film came out. Not quite finished yet, but considering post-apocalypse survival is almost a genre in its own right of which I&#039;ve read several, it is very good. He really crafts his words and that just makes it all the more sad and uncomfortable to read and yet paradoxically hard to put down.</p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">At the cinema:</span></p><p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1182345/" target="_blank">Moon</a> - David Bowie&#039;s sun pays homage to Silent Running, 2001 and Space 1999 with music by Clint Mansell of Pop Will Eat Itself, who seems to be doing a nice job of scoring films these days. Sam Rockwell is a fine actor.</p><p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1136608/" target="_blank">District 9</a> - Really excellent for the first 45 minutes. Very funny and satirical. Then it goes a bit rubbish as they forget the satire and turn it into something akin to a computer game shoot &#039;em up which goes on for far too long. And it has plot holes you could drive a car through. That said I really enjoyed it cos it was fresh and I really hope they don&#039;t ruin the good work with a sequel.</p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">On DVD:</span></p><p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1125849/" target="_blank">The Wrestler</a> - speaking of Clint Mansell, he scored this too. I felt so depressed watching this I watched it in two sittings! A study of decay and lost dreams. Very good.</p><p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0224853/" target="_blank">The Corner</a> - again really hard work, but fine stuff. Docu-drama of life on a Baltimore street in the 90s. Along with Homicide, this was a foundation for The Wire. I&#039;m sure we used to make things like this in this country once upon a time.</p><p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407362/" target="_blank">Battlestar Galactica</a> - from the sublime to the ridiculous. The first couple of series were cheesy but pretty good allegories and examinations of a society&#039;s response to terrorism/war. It&#039;s ended up in some sub-Matrix pseudo-religious nonsense.</p><p><br /><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070723/" target="_blank">Soylent Green</a> - I&#039;ve been having a bit of a dystopia festival recently including this film! Charlton Heston from 1973 in an overpopulated world where the dead are taken out with the rubbish and the greenhouse effect has killed most of Nature. Not brilliant but has some great bits and the mood is spot-on.</p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">On TV:</span></p><p>The Cell - It&#039;s been on BBC 4 and will be on BBC 2 soon no doubt. Pretty decent biology primer. I learnt a fair bit and it&#039;s related to my work if you&#039;re interested. The Professor in the office next door to me was the consultant for the third episode!</p><p>Spiral II - the French crime drama is finally back on BBC 4. Highly unbelievable and suffers from some of the problems of most mainstream crime drama, but still pretty good and different enough to be interesting. </p><p>Getting On - I watched quite a lot of this through my fingers. Excellent cringe comedy from Jo Brand set in a hospital.</p><p> </p><p></p><span></span><p></p>

Richard Dawkin&#039;s book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Blind-Watchmaker-Richard-Dawkins/dp/0141026162/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1246728286&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">The Blind Watchmaker</a> is devoted to explaining how this mechanism works.</p><p><br />It is perhaps paradoxical to observe that I have an evolved conciousness that allows me to reflect on the point that I exist because of a mechanism of selection that has acted blindly and has yielded me - but it is perfectly possible for this happen without any kind of &#039;guiding intention&#039; just by millions of years of trial and error and the laws of thermodynamics. (And if that raises the question, why is the universe set-up like this then? Well, you can go several ways on that one, but none of them involve evidence or hold much hope of any becoming available any time soon). Further and perhaps even more ironic to me is the fact that I appear to have evolved with this operating system worse than Vista called Conciousness that comes with applications called &#039;intuition&#039; and &#039;emotions&#039; which are really buggy and tantalise me with all these tricks of seeing my life as a narrative or important in&#160; some way, that could tempt me into thinking that evolution wasn&#039;t simply a mechanism chugging away with no greater purpose but to select and propagate life. </p><p>Ok, that may be too nihilistic for most people, but as has been noted by several psychologists, actually it&#039;s normal people who are deluded. Rose tinted glasses are a very necessary thing for mental well being. Depressed people tend to do better in tests where one is required to make objective judgements, thus suggesting seeing reality as it really is perhaps ain&#039;t such a great thing - which is a selective pressure in itself when it comes to the species. I think I&#039;ve written before about how Daniel Gilbert noted that most of us exist in a state oscillating around the junction between reality and delusion - too much delusion and one goes dancing in traffic, too much reality and I can&#039;t get out of bed!</p><p>One more point on this - I think this realisation that evolution is simply a mechanism is a major reason why one should take the time to consider things from a moral point of view and think for oneself about everything one holds dear. At a single stroke it destroys the basis for practically every prejudice there is - race, sexuality, gender etc. - take away &#039;intention&#039;, &#039;purpose&#039; or the idea of being &#039;chosen&#039; or that we&#039;re inevitably going in a particular direction towards something - then one has to start getting real about what one believes when it comes to calibrating what is right and what is wrong. </p><p>Right, down off one soapbox and onto another. I&#039;m a bit concerned about my next bit coming across like an advert for Microsoft, but credit where credit is due...</p><p>This week I was up in Cambridge for the Microsoft Summer School at their Research Centre there, aka MSR&#160; - co-sponsors for my research alongside the Medical Research Council. I don&#039;t expect I&#039;ll ever be a millionaire, but this a little of what I imagine the life is like - having my every need attended to, meeting high flyers and people of power and influence and experiencing priviledge way outside my everyday life. To address the cynicism I myself have - there is of course a quid pro quo - MSR spend maybe a million pounds a year on their PhD students overall, but the return if one of us does come up with something cool&#160; that feeds into their products could be many many times greater. And this money is such a tiny fraction of their income. </p><p>Amongst the researchers themselves at least, they do genuinely appear to want to be more than simply a big old hated monopoly - there does appear to be a social conscience at play and hence large investments in research that may be of social benefit without necessarily yielding economic return. That said, there is still a part of me that says, &#039;well it&#039;s easy to be magnanimous when one holds the reigns of power. It&#039;s giving away ones power that is really meaningful.&#039;</p><p>However, I&#039;ve been treated like a prince for a week, so I should emphasise the positives - amazing place, amazing people, don&#039;t think I spent any money in the entire week and there was such attention to detail in making sure everyone felt included, had there specific needs met and just generally in being welcomed and looked after, I was blown away. The full schedule is <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/events/2009summerschool/" target="_blank">here</a> but the highlights were: One, the go-karting on Monday. Way more fun than I expected and I can understand why people get into cars now. I didn&#039;t even notice that I&#039;d bruised myself until the next day, such was the adrenaline rush from power sliding and opposite lock and getting into battles with my colleagues. Secondly was Jesus College itself. I feel quite conflicted about the privilege people in Cambridge receive. Maybe it does act an incentive for people that such places exist, but I would prefer that the money and power was spread more evenly across the globe, even if it meant I personally had less. But as it stands, I got to stay in this immaculately maintained ancient college (see the picture above) and was waited upon at a five course dinner while I sat next to one of the designers of the ZX81 (first computer I ever used) and the BBC Micro. Did I really do that? Yes, apparently I did.</p><p>Then there were the seminars themselves and the other students. I was feeling really quite intimidated the first couple of days - there are some seriously clever people there - but once I decided to stop worrying about what I&#039;m not, it was just fun to talk to them and hear about their work. Some really excellent speakers among the presenters too and I got to play with some cool technology.</p><p>If you want to know more and see my poster - which is hopefully digestible for the non-expert - then follow the link above to the schedule and you can read about the various speakers and download things like my poster (it&#039;s near the bottom of the page) and power point files of some of the presentations.&#160;</p><p>My favourite was Drew Purves, but I think his presentation may be unavailable due to content of a commercially or research sensitive nature. David Mackay was ace too (he&#039;s not part of MSR) and I&#039;m going to see I can get either or both of them to visit Southampton to give their talks here.</p><p>So kudos to Microsoft for showing me another side of the behemoth - they are much more than just those idiots who make crashware!</p><p>Back to reality for me now. I&#039;ve been mulling over whether I&#039;m really cut out for the PhD. My week away has given me a bit of a boost, but I&#039;m still not sure - and this is not false modesty - if I am clever enough to do this and whether it just makes me too unhappy grinding away at it like I have been. I&#039;ve still got a couple of months to look at the options and make up my mind about whether to stick or quit, but
I&#039;m not 100% committed to the cause at the moment. Perhaps not the happiest note to end on, but that is how things are at the time of writing.</p><p>Please send all objections, corrections and anything else to the usual address or post it as a coment below ;-)</p><p> </p>

It&#039;s only 25-30 minutes and to people in my department, but it&#039;ll be the first real time I have to account for my work in the last six months. I&#039;m going to talk about modelling and simulation in the context of research into the immune system.</span></p><p><span>Science and Art have a lot of similarities (at least in my mind) in that they are both trying to express something about reality. Picasso famously said in 1923 that &quot;Art is the lie that helps us realise the truth.&quot; And this concept of imperfect artificial constructions helping us to understand more deeply what is real is very much how my research - modelling of the immune system - is proceeding.</span></p><p><span>Science itself is often about hierarchies of organisation. At the most fundamental level is Physics, where scientists are trying to understand what exactly reality is made of, the particles that make atoms etc. One problem that often occurs down here is that things cannot often be observed directly. So something like the results of experiments to look for the fundamental particles of which the universe is made at the Large Hadron Collider is analogous to turning up at the scene of a burglary and trying to figure out who committed the crime from the mess they left behind.</span></p><p><span>On the next level up in the hierarchy, one may be trying to understand how these particles combine to form groups of particles and how these groupings are organised and interact as systems.<br /></span></p><p><span>Then one might jump up to another level where these groups of particles are large enough to be considered entities in their own right and express patterns of behaviour that can be observed and predicted without worrying about what every individual particle is doing. <br /></span></p><p><span>And so on and so forth, right up to people and societies and galaxies. One important point being (assuming one accepts this concept of a hierarchy) that the rules governing the lower levels place constraints upon what is possible at the higher levels.</span></p><p><span>I too am working at a level where it is difficult, if not impossible to observe things directly and that is where modelling/simulation comes in. We can observe cells under a microscope and see some components of cells even, but to go deeper is not possible with visible light as the molecules - proteins - are too small to be resolved this way. Technical note: resolution is defined as the ability to distinguish between two separate points. If you want to test yourself, draw two dots on a bit of white paper close together, lean it against something and walk back. You should reach a point where it starts to look like one dot. That&#039;s the resolution limit of your vision. For more fun, you can do this on your skin with a friend using two pencils. Close your eyes and they should start with the pencils far apart, say touching on your upper and lower arm and then gradually they put them at points closer and closer together. Again there will be a distance where it feels like you are being touched with just one pencil - the resolution limit for your sense of touch - it&#039;ll be different for different parts of your body.</span></p><p><span>But I digress. So I am trying to model entities - proteins - that exist in almost all our cells and have been observed as having a role in travelling to the cell surface and signalling to our immune systems whether the cell from which they come is diseased or not - and therefore whether it should be killed or not. Understanding this process - how and why some diseases are signalled and some not - would be very helpful in treating everything from Cancer to Swine Flu.</span></p><p><span>So as these proteins can&#039;t be observed in situ, one strategy is to make models based on what can be observed and perform simulations to figure out the things that can&#039;t be observed directly. So far I have modelled the static structure of two proteins and I am now modelling the dynamic interaction of these two proteins and eventually I hope to progress to whole systems of proteins. As with the hierarchy I described before, it is a case of start simple and progress to complexity once one is confident that the rules and assumptions are sound (enough) at each stage. Ultimately any model is only as useful as the real experiments that validate it, but the point of the model is to suggest and ideally predict which experiments to carry out. Hopefully by the end of the summer I will have enough information for my colleagues over at the Hospital to do some experiments and test my results and that will be quite exciting (in a small way) as I will feel like I&#039;ve done some real Science, something new - the lies of my simulations hopefully giving insight into the truth of our immune systems.</span></p><p>------------------------------------------</p><p>That took most of the run and then I was thinking about things on the cultural front.

Or if it even made sense...</p><p><span>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /></span></p><p><span>April 19 2009</span></p><p><span>It&#039;s just past the six month mark for my PhD. Spring is here and I&#039;m feeling tired and a bit more lost than usual. Here&#039;s a bit of science and philosophy as an attempt to figure things out.</span></p><p><span>I&#039;ve been mulling as I often do on the nature of choices - the very fact of having them or not having them, the extent to which one has free will or not. Partly cos this is something I do a lot of anyway and partly cos this speaks directly to my research. I chose this path from the paths available to me and my actions previously interacted with the world such as to lead to this set of paths. Obviously one does not choose to be born or the circumstances that one is born into. Growing up is process of moving from a situation of having no power to make decisions to a situation where one becomes increasingly more able to make and be responsible for ones decisions. I&#039;d probably use this phenomena to define what it means to be an adult - a person actively chooses and who takes responsibility for the consequences of their actions. (Likewise I&#039;d define being English as: to be neurotic about food and obsessed with house prices).</span></p><p><span>Foresight is not perfect and hence many decisions one makes are bad and the consequences not good, but most of us learn to a lesser or greater extent through this process and the results are ultimately what we call experience and wisdom. This is fine when right and wrong are obvious and the decisions are simple choices, but personally I find that the vast majority of situations are complex and it is not a simple matter to know what to expect when one makes a choice. Even with hindsight it&#039;s often not obvious if one choice was superior to another. One of my favourite expressions is that the road to hell is paved with good intentions - certainly I&#039;ve been down to hell a few times on the receiving end of other peoples good intentions and I&#039;ve built a fair bit of the road too - so it always pull my up when I catch myself or someone else being a bit too certain about what they&#039;re doing.</span></p><p><span>Anyhow, before I start riffing on my low opinion of the human race, my point was really that it seems that we are all faced with the almost impossible situation that the world is very complex and yet one must constantly make decisions - doing nothing still being a choice of sorts. So troubled as I am about myself and other people, ultimately it&#039;s a wish for a bit more tolerance in the world.</span></p><p><span>And this is not to ignore the evidence that shows how our decisions can be made without recourse to concious thought i.e. that we don&#039;t always exercise free will - as I was discussing the other day, the hypothesis being that conciousness exists on a spectrum from unconscious to fully aware and much of our inherited survival abilities would have evolved prior to the kind of reflection and introspection I&#039;m demonstrating (far too much of) here. So it&#039;s not surprising that many of our decisions are made without recourse to free will, we are evolved animals after all and choosing a mate or avoiding a predator is perhaps best done without running it past your fore brain first.</span></p><p><span>Right, that&#039;s part of the back story, here I am (in this universe, just to cover the parallel worlds scenario) wondering about my choices past and present and here&#039;s another assumption I operate under: The universe is governed by rules that are themselves based upon natural phenomena. That is to say there is nothing magical or supernatural that directs the universe we observe (which is not to exclude God if you&#039;re that way inclined, but if they exist, they are outside the system and not interacting with it.) This assumption is a lot deeper than it may first seem. A lot of people seem to think that it implies reduction of complexity and that this somehow leads to some kind of loss. To me this in no way implies that a squeezing of ones imagination or that disciplines like Art lose any value or Artists lose their ability to create or for one to have opinions about such things. What it does say to me is that - Hey! You there. Your actions have real consequences and there&#039;s no magical solutions to your problems or anyone else&#039;s, so stop acting like you can&#039;t think for yourself and stop oppressing other people cos you&#039;re too dumb to question the dogma you got fed as a child and your own animal inheritance. The assumption of rules governing the universe presents the possibility of testing and evidence and actually making decisions without them being founded in dogma, instinct and stupidity.</span></p><p><span>And as far as I can tell we are in no danger of running out of complex phenomena to understand and reducing the world to a simple set of equations and robbing anyone of their creativity and imagination. If anything we&#039;re pretty much at the beginning and the human race is more in danger of extinction than running out of things to think about and stuff to do.</span></p><p><span>If you accept my assumption about the universe and its underlying objective nature (and also perhaps&#160; battling with </span><span>ideas about </span><span>our own nature and place within the universe) then one question raised is how to find these rules? Can it even be done? That is essentially what Science is - the attempt to find the rules and test the assumption - and my long preamble is an attempt to encapsulate the spirit guiding a wide range of approaches to this question which I would argue have been more successful than anything else we&#039;ve come up with. This being perhaps why more traditional philosophical disciplines have been in decline - they don&#039;t produce many testable hypotheses, however interesting they may be to think about, and usefulness is significant in determining the fitness of ideas and ultimately survival in the same way as it is for living things.<br /></span></p><p><span>Which finally brings me to my PhD. Here&#039;s another assumption or maybe a proposition might be better: Is nature stochastic? (Stochastic deriving from the Greek, &quot;to guess&quot; and means &quot;random&quot; or &quot;chance&quot;) Does the universe operate according to probabilities and chance rather than outcomes determined with total certainty by the preceding set of circumstances?</span></p><p><span>Ok, that&#039;s really a trick question- cos it&#039;s not one that can be answered. It&#039;s one thing to assume nature has an objective reality, but like the existence of God, it&#039;s not something that ca
n be proved one way or the other and hence one is always stuck with an assumption. A better proposition might be: Is it better to choose to model nature as stochastic or deterministic? Does one approach produce more reliable rules than another?</span></p><p><span>That is something we can test for usefulness. And the answer is: It depends.</span></p><p><span>In my PhD the approach to understanding the behaviour of molecules inside cells is to assume they are stochastic processes. In other words in modelling the behaviour of the molecules, we assume a set of possible outcomes may occur weighted according to probabilities inherent within the model system we create. By comparing this to what can be observed in the behaviour of real molecules, we hope to derive the properties of the molecules themselves and the properties of real living organisms. Ultimately this knowledge then would be used for developing medicines - my department being Cancer Sciences - but the knowledge being fundamentally immunology/biochemistry.<br /></span></p><p><span>So why do it this way? This goes back to where we started - choices and complexity....<br /></span></p>

All I can say is 'stunning'. Philospophy and science all in one.
From my own studies all I can say is that Kant had to make a simiar assumption: that nature appears to have a purpose (which we cannot know) so we must treat nature AS IF it had a purpose.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-size:13px;text-align:left;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><a href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/c1996-6a00d8348a3d9b69e2011278daf83d28a4-120wi.jpg" style="display:inline;"><img alt="NB3L" class="at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e2011278daf83d28a4 " src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/c1996-6a00d8348a3d9b69e2011278daf83d28a4-120wi.jpg" /></a>
</p><p style="font-size:13px;text-align:left;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">Getting back to my roots with a bit of Film Studies to start this post:</p><p style="font-size:13px;text-align:left;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">One way I judge the quality of a film is how much I find myself thinking about it afterwards. I saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0456396/" target="_blank">L&#039;Enfant</a> on Wednesday and while I thought it good, it didn&#039;t touch me too greatly. But here I am on Sunday still mulling it over. To me that&#039;s a sign of a great film. It is easy to call it depressing - a film about the life in an industrial Belgium town of the kind people that in the UK most nice middle class people like me would cross the road to avoid - but it&#039;s so unusual to see a film about this strata of society, played out so dispassionately. I find it compelling and moving the more I think about it. Obviously I am a pretentious bleeding heart (goes without saying really) but it reminded me of Kieslowski&#039;s 10 commandments films and the ideas from Foucault about how we treat the lowest and most vulnerable members of our society tells us much about ourselves and how &#039;civilised&#039; we are. What I&#039;ve been mulling over are the pathways that lead to the kind of desperate and anti-social&#160; and self-destructive behaviour of the characters in the film and those who I see on the street or I have known.</p><p style="font-size:13px;text-align:left;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"> Essentially I&#039;ve been thinking about how messed up the world is for about the billionth time and how complex the problems are to solve! There&#039;s a great line in the second Gwyneth Jones book about how the real problem is not making things simple but keeping them complicated. The implication being that simple thinking is the source of prejudice and fascism, where as vagueness and messiness are the reality and staying complex in ones thinking is key to treating others with humanity. </p><p style="font-size:13px;text-align:left;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">Bruno the principal protagonist is a true nihilist anti-hero of which there is nothing cool at all. He really is a large child living only in the moment for almost the entire film and that is really frightening to me.<br />Stylistically it has nods to Italian Neo-realism and one theme it follows that I&#039;m always interested in is the subversion of modern technology to needs beyond those intended by the designers. As with the Wire this revolves around the use of mobile phones and vehicles for crime that intersects with more universal themes of the type that Dickens depicted. </p><p style="font-size:13px;text-align:left;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">By coincidence, the last film I saw prior to that was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053472/" target="_blank">Breathless</a> or A Bout de Souffle if you prefer. Another film with a nihilistic central character - but oh so cool. One of the coolest films ever made. Jump cuts, jazz, smoking, fast cars, guns, beautiful people and meditations on how tiresome modern life is. I&#039;d forgotten what a truly great piece of Art it is. Someone taking the medium and really doing something new with it. And it&#039;s a document of it&#039;s time, 1960 in Paris. Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seburg are the two most beautiful and terrible people in the world in that film.</p><p style="font-size:13px;text-align:left;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">So two films worth checking out if you have the time and inclination for those kind of things.</p><p style="font-size:13px;text-align:left;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">I saw Breathless on my afternoon off when I spent the week in Cambridge, a couple of weeks ago.</p><p style="font-size:12px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;text-align:left;"></p><p style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"></p><p style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"></p><p style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"></p>
<p style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">I was in Cambridge visiting Microsoft Research, where my supervisor Andrew is based, for a week of induction into the world of Microsoft and Computer Modelling. Here are some thoughts on Microsoft and Cambridge I wrote at the time and the picture at the top is of the <a href="http://www.quns.cam.ac.uk/Queens/Images/WinBridg.html" target="_blank">Bridge</a> at Queens College:</p><p style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;text-align:center;">---------------------------------------------------</p>
<p style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">Imagine if you will, a brand new building all glass and steel and exposed
concrete columns. Lots of space and natural light. It&#039;s high security, but once
you&#039;re in then it&#039;s a world of calm and soft colours</p>
<p style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><span></span>My desk is situated in a large
office space in a group of four in an<span> </span>open plan area with a kitchen and sofas
surrounded on both sides by rows <span></span>of offices for the big cheeses. The
kitchen is stocked with fruit, <span></span>biscuits and energy bars. There is a
fancy tea and coffee machine that <span></span>makes very nice lattes. Around the
corner is a big glass fronted cooler<span> </span>with spring water, juice and fizzy
drinks. One can help oneself to as<br />
<span></span>much as one wants. <span></span>The desk is spacious and I have a comfy
expensive Herman Miller Aero <span></span>chair.&#160; </p><p style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">Perhaps what&#039;s so
amazing is the extravagance of space. The <span></span>floor I&#039;m on is maybe about half the
size of a football pitch and there are maybe 15-20 people
occupying the whole floor. <span></span>One would never get claustrophobia
working there. <span></span>In fact, my only gripe is that it&#039;s a
bit too quiet - no hijinks or larking about whatsoever. Everyone is
super professional and focused.<br />
</p><p style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><span></span>The building is located in the science
park and we have lunch with the<span> </span>physicists over in the Cavendish Laboratory
canteen. (Sadly nerds, not the canteen that Maxwell or Watson and Crick would have
eaten in. The Lab moved from it’s original location in 1974). Apparently the
University wouldn&#039;t allow Microsoft to have their own catering and Microsoft
even <span></span>had to build the building, sell it to
the University and now rent it back in order to occupy that spot!<br />
</p><p style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><span></span>I walk there under big open skies to the
sound of birdsong and bicycles <span></span>and back again under darkening horizons
and the sounds of church bells. <span></span>It is quite a contrast to the hectic
rush of the Avenue and the sense of<span> </span>enclosure in Southampton.</p><p style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><span></span>My accommodation is pretty basic, even
if the college itself is <span></span>luxurious, like staying in Hogwarts. I have to share a
shower and toilet which is a bit grotty, <span></span>but I can&#039;t complain when everything
else is on a level of privilege <span></span>outside my usual experience. (Andrew did
mention that a year ago I&#039;d <span></span>have been in a 4 star hotel, but such is
the credit crunch).<br />
</p><p style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><span></span>What I&#039;ve seen of Cambridge so far feels
like what England is like in a<span> </span>Richard Curtis film - no oiks and everyone acts with <span></span>that upper class sense of entitlement.
It does make me a bit<span>&#160; </span>uncomfortable but suppose new places
take getting used to. I have an inverse snobbery prejudice, I can&#039;t deny it. I tend to find myself wanting to commit acts of violence on people who are more posh or more middle class than me just cos I assume they&#039;ve had a nicer life than me and it&#039;s all so unfair and I want them to suffer a bit more - it&#039;s wrong and irrational I know and I can see beyond it, but the feelings are there! And it has
been a good week so far on the<span> </span>learning front which is the real point
of being here. </p><p style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;text-align:center;">-----------------------------------------</p><p style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">I&#039;m due to go and live in Cambridge for a couple of months next year, so I better show some adaptability and get over my issues. And I did meet some really interesting people and began making new contacts in the world of academia relating to Biology and Computer modelling. In fact it&#039;s off the back of one meeting that at the end of March I&#039;m going for a week <span id="afterPageTitle"></span>at the School of Mathematics at the University of Leeds for the impressively named Graduate School in Non linear and Stochastic Systems<span> in Biology. (I only included that cos the fancy words sound really clever!) Once again, I&#039;m wondering, &quot;Where did it all go right?&quot; and suspiciously looking around for the lurking disaster and my personal regression to the mean...(I want one of <a href="http://despair.com/pessimistsmug.html" target="_blank">these</a>)</span><span></span></p><p style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">Returning to Art for a moment, before I finish and go back to Science and my report writing: One of my favourite Computer writers <a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/" target="_blank">Charles Petzold</a> has reviewed <a href="http://theartinstinct.com/" target="_blank">The Art Instinct</a> on his site. This ties in nicely with all the Darwin stuff on TV (and if you didn&#039;t catch the fine David Attenborough documentary recently there&#039;s this excellent 6 minute version on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6IrUUDboZo" target="_blank">YouTube</a> ) as it is a book that attempts to relate evolution and creativity. I&#039;m adding it to my ever growing reading list, but if anyone likes the look of it and gets there first, let me know what you think.</p><p style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"></p><p style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"></p><p style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#039;s 4 weeks to my first deadline - that of my five month report - so I thought as a way of sorting out some thoughts I&#039;d post a sort of primer on Cancer - or what I&#039;ve learnt so far about that aspect of my studies.<br />What follows owes a lot to a seminar at Southampton General Hospital by Graham Packham and a paper from 2000 called The Hallmarks of Cancer by Douglas Hanahan and Robert A. Weinberg.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">What is cancer, where does it come from &amp; how common is it?</span></strong></p><p>Cancer is a genetic disease that begins with the production of a single cell that has evaded the control systems that have evolved to regulate the processes of cell division, growth and repair. So when we say it is genetic, we mean that enough of the genes within the cell have mutated to spawn a cell that can overcome the controls. Mutations of our genes can happen by natural random chance, by environmental factors such as from the chemicals in cigarettes or overexposure to sunlight or by&#160; bacterial or viral infection.</p><p>This rogue cell then goes on to multiply and grow more cells just like the original. The end result, if not treated, is ultimately death as either the vital organs fail to function or because the body is unable to produce sufficient red blood cells to provide the body with the oxygen it needs to function. There are over 100 different &#039;types&#039; of cancer, occurring at different sites within the body, with different ages of onset, different courses of progression, different underlying causes and needing a variety of different treatments. Generally though, as it starts with one cell, it can often take years or decades before the cancer has grown enough cells for symptoms to become apparent. </p><p>From an individual point of view cancer is a common disease. The current harsh facts are that about 1 in 3 of us will suffer from cancer and 1 in 4 will die from cancer. However, from a cells point of view it is extremely rare to be a cancer cell. Humans are estimated to have 10 to the power 14 cells - that&#039;s 10 followed by 14 zeros - growing, dividing and dying throughout our lifetimes, so to be a cancer cell is to be a very very rare thing. Further to this the natural mutation rate of genes within cells is so slow that it is estimated that you&#039;d need to live one hundred years to acquire enough mutations in one cell to get cancer. Hence the significance of environmental and pathogen mutations. In any event, to repeat it can take 20 years from the appearance of a cancer cell for it to replicate and grow to the size of a tumour.</p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>The acquired capabilities of a cancer cell or &#039;what makes you so special, huh?&#039;</strong></span></p><p>I&#039;ve reproduced a diagram here (D. Hanahan and A. Weinberg, 2000) that shows what have been identified as the 6 capabilities a cell must acquire to become cancerous (click on it to make it larger).</p><p><a href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/ea33f-6a00d8348a3d9b69e2011168395d7d970c-120wi.png" style="display:inline;"><img alt="HMC" class="at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e2011168395d7d970c " src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/ea33f-6a00d8348a3d9b69e2011168395d7d970c-120wi.png" /></a> </p><p>One thing to note is that these capabilities do not to be acquired by a cell in a particular order or at a particular rate - hence the circle - and some may occur simultaneously, but it must have all of them to become cancerous.</p><p>Bearing that in mind, the six capabilities are described in an arbitrary order, the &quot;how?&quot; and &quot;why?&quot; of these capabilities is obviously what researchers are trying to understand, so this is really just an outline of the &quot;what?&quot; part of the big question:</p><p>1. <strong>Self-sufficiency in growth signals</strong>: cells need to be told when to grow and are instructed by signals upstream that lead to cell growth downstream. Cancer cells appear to have developed mutations that allow them to turn on the downstream signals without recourse to these instructions and override the usual pathways. </p><p>For example the HER2 receptor has been identified as over expressed in 20-30%&#160; of breast cancer tumours and this causes these cancer cells to be hyper responsive to normal growth factor conditions and proliferate in a way that normal cells would not as they would need greater stimulation.&#160;</p><p>2. <strong>Insensitivity to growth inhibition </strong>: conversely to growth, cancer cells acquire the ability to ignore the usual anti-growth signals that act as a check on uncontrolled growth of cells.</p><p>An example of how this can occur is via the human papillomavirus that is has been identified as a major cause of cervical cancer. This has been shown to disrupt the function of pRb anti-growth inhibition pathway in cells. Hence the national vaccination programme that began in the UK against this virus for teenage girls in 2008 which will doubtless save many women&#039;s lives. (And doubtless will lead to the usual moral hand wringing and health scares around sex and vaccinations - dumb humans, but whatyagonnado?)</p><p>3. <strong>Evasion of Apoptosis </strong>: which is a fancy word for suicide. Or programmed cell death, if you prefer. Cell death is an everyday part of life (and hence part of the reason for eating is to make new cells). The cells themselves and the immune systems cells are constantly on the look out for signs of damage or dangerous mutations. And should a cell or an immune system cell notice something is wrong, the cell either decides to do the decent thing or is told to do so by the immune system and then offs itself. Once triggered it can take just 30 minutes for the cell to defragment and the corpse gets consumed within 24 hours - waste not, want not - consider that as a bioweapon - pretty scary, huh? Cancer cells turn off these internal mechanisms and thus can ignore these instructions.</p><p>The inactivation of the p53 tumour suppressing protein is thought to be a common example of such an evasion of apoptosis in cancer cells thought to occur in over 50% of all tumours. This can happen through mutations resulting by chance or exposure to environmental factors such as chemicals in cigarettes, radiation from the sun or pathogens such as viruses.</p><p>4. <strong>Limitless replicative potential </strong>: as well as the potential for suicide, normal cells have a limited ability to reproduce themselves. Each time a cell copies itself some genetic information is lost and eventually they cannot replicate any more (on average after 70 divisions and this doesn&#039;t apply to stem cells.) The very reason for this limit, it is proposed, is that it is a product of evolution that acts as a form of cancer prevention. Cancer cells turn on an enzyme that overcomes this built-in limitation in 85-90% of tumours. This may occur via the usual mutagenic or pathogenic pathways outlined in 3.</p><p>5. <strong>Sustained angiogenesis </strong>: a fancy word for describing the growth of red blood cells, which is how cells get oxygen. As anyone who&#039;s tried to breathe underwater knows, humans can&#039;t extract oxygen from water like fish can. But our cells can&#039;t survive without it and therefore neither can we. Hence we breathe air into our lungs and they extract oxygen and it is then redistributed to the rest of our bodies via our red blood cells. For a cell to access the oxygen they carry (and other nutrients) it must be within 100 micrometres of a capillary blood vessel or they will starve and die. That&#039;s in the range of the thickness of a human hair. The process of angiogenesis is tightly controlled, so cancers must overcome these controls for them to proliferate and grow into tumours. Trying to understand how cancer cells influence the angiogenesis triggers and inhibitors is an area of intense research and is not wel
l understood. It is proposed that it is an early to mid-stage event in human cancers and is therefore a target for future treatments. Like putting out a fire, exclude oxygen and it will extinguish.</p><p>6.<strong> Tumour Invasion &amp; Metastasis </strong>: sooner or later in most cancers development, if left unchecked, it will go from being a clump of cells in one place - a tumour - and spread itself around the body. This tumour invasion, the setting up of colony tumours is called metastasis. It&#039;s responsible for 90% of all deaths, but it is an ability that must also be acquired by the primary tumour. These processes are complex and not fully understood. But for example, the alteration of several proteins involved in tethering cells to their environments have been identified in tissues surrounding metastatic capable cells.</p><p>The final big factor in all this is, as already outlined, is the acceleration of mutation rates in genes due to pathogens, environmental exposures to mutagens such as UV radiation and thirdly due an existing inherited genetic mutation. To repeat, that is how the final obstacle of so many mutations occurring within one cell in less than 100 years is overcome that allows these six abilities to be acquired.</p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Treatments - Current and Pending</strong></span></p><p>The most basic treatment is surgery to cut out the tumour. This obviously happens once a cancer tumour has been identified and goes alongside other treatments, as it is difficult if not impossible to know if surgery has removed all of the cells.</p><p>Most people have heard of chemotherapy &amp; radiotherapy, which essentially the use of toxins or radiation to kill cancer cells. The principal downside being that the toxins and radiation kill cells other than the cancer cells. Interestingly it was suggested to me when I joined Cancer Sciences that the destructive effect on the immune system cells of chemotherapy may stimulate an immune response that also aids in the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Point being though, it&#039;s not well understood how it works and it&#039;s not what one might call a targeted treatment, but it has saved many lives so far.</p><p>Identification of pathogens and mutagens and prevention of exposure to them, such as banning smoking in pubs, wearing sunblock or vaccination against the human papillomavirus have already been mentioned, but this is a very important form of prevention that should not be overlooked.</p><p>The latest currently available treatments are Antibody based treatments. Drugs you may have heard of include Herceptin for some Breast Cancers or Rituxan for Non-Hodgkin&#039;s Lymphoma. </p><p>If we return to section 1 above and the acquisition of self-sufficiency to growth signals of cancer cells: Herceptin is a molecule (an antibody) designed to bind to HER2 receptor, inhibiting them and thereby prevent these cells from growing more of themselves through this pathway in the 20-30% of breast cancers which have this feature. It is also thought to inhibit angiogenesis. </p><p>So the purpose of these treatments is to create antibody molecules that target aspects of cancer cells that inhibit aspects of the six hallmark features and arrest their progress, ideally ultimately causing them to die off. This type of treatment will also go hand in hand with surgery and other traditional treatments, but it is much more targeted to the individual type of cancer and thus less damaging and more successful.</p><p>Several antibody treatments for other cancers have been developed and will be available in the next year or two.</p><p>Future treatments include DNA fusion vaccination. This is a more active approach to immunotherapy and aims to activate the immune system to destroy cancers directly. This works by identifying the genes associated with a particular cancer and fusing it with another bit of DNA from a pathogen that is known to cause an immune response. This attempts to get over the problem of our immune systems seeing cancers as part of our own bodies and leaving them alone. A vaccine created from pathogen-cancer fused DNA is then injected to the patient and stimulates an immune response from the host immune system to kill all cells with that protein motif including the tumour cells. As well as being targeted this has the advantage of hopefully generating immunity against the cancer returning in the way that other vaccines do.</p><p>Trials of such a vaccine for prostate cancer in humans are now on going, so this type of treatment may be available in the next few years.</p><p>Lastly, to relate this back to my own work: I&#039;m currently involved at the far end of the research and treatment development process. I&#039;m trying to help figure out mechanisms inside cells that relate to how the immune system sees diseases. It&#039;s unclear (to me anyway) how, if these are fully understood, that they can be turned into treatments and it was mentioned recently that it may be more useful for HIV than Cancer, but such is research. Point being, it could be 20 years before anything I do now filters down into something available in the clinic, if it filters down at all.</p><p>So feel free to email me questions or to point out any errors etc. And I hope that was useful to someone other than me! </p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Something to bear in mind</strong></span></p><p>One final point, the best thing for all of us is not to worry too much about getting ill - eat a decent amount of fresh fruit and vegetables, get some regular gentle exercise, don&#039;t unnecessarily expose yourself to anything nasty, take advantage of the vaccines available for common illnesses - and the odds for a long and healthy life are pretty good. (But I have no prescription for it being a happy life!)</p><p>&#160; </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Al,
Thankyou for that. I did find this article of yours to be most interesting which surprised me! Would it be true to say (and pardon me if I am showing my ignorance by stating the obvious) that cancer is the biggest killer of the human species? If so it is somewhat a twist of nature that although mankind can find cures for many diseases and ailments it is so far unable to do so for the biggest killer of them all? Is this one of those endless quests that may never be solved, in which case should we not be re-focussing efforts and indeed money much more into prevention. I am of course thinking out loud and it would of course be daft to completely stop research but I do feel that people are still not educated enough into the quite sophisticated ways and means of cancer. To have a globally co-ordinated information campaign may indeed make people think again about how to go about life in order to lead a fuller life? It is true that cancer (as far as my limited knowledge will allow) does not discriminate. An example being a close friend of mine who live a clean and healthy lifestyle. He kept fit and did not drink or smoke, contracted cancer of the tongue. When at the doctor after having investigated the family history which was pretty clean of cancer the doctor then turned to my friend and said "I am sorry but it looks like you have been dealt a bad hand in life!" I am glad to say that after a couple of surgeries including the removal of half his tongue he is now in remission. This sort of takes me back to my point about whether a cure will ever be found. Many people in India would say that my friend must have done something bad in a past life and therefore carries bad Karma with him in this life! I personally do not believe this but it cannot be discounted as we truely do not know why this has happened to him. Sorry to ramble on a bit but I am kind of thinking out loud to help me to understand ..... WHY ?
Bestest..... and keep up the good work.
Sanjiv

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Woah...big questions! I don't have concrete simple answers, but what I can say is that my understanding generally is that overall the biggest top 4 killers worldwide are ranked as cardiovascular diseases (heart attacks etc.), infectious/parasitical diseases (covering a wide range from measles to malaria) then third are cancers and then strokes.
Secondly and importantly - it will very much depend on where you live - if you are born in parts of Africa then HIV/AIDS or Malaria are much more likely to kill you and thus you won't live long enough to get cancer or heart disease.
And if you went back to the 1950s, then you and your family would be very much at risk from diseases now eradicated/controlled by vaccinations such as smallpox or measles. So the times one lives in are also a factor. Go back further and death by cholera in the UK was very prevalent and has been eradicated by social policies that brought about the construction of modern sewage systems. So it's not just medical research, it's good governance and good science that solve these problems.
As far as evolution is concerned all that matters is that we live long enough to reproduce - harsh, but there it is - so things like cancer are a consequence of the evolutionary pressure to ensure survival at the expense of what are in evolutionary terms - lesser problems, such as living disease free and for a long time.
The 'why?' question is not really something that science can address - at least not philosophically - but there is good progress being made into the 'how' and 'what' aspects of cancer and many other diseases. And just as we reap the benefits of the work and sacrifices of our ancestors, so our descendants will reap that of the work that is done today. Which is cold comfort for your friend who needed it now, but that is the way it is unfortunately and luck cannot be eliminated, but the odds can be tipped our way through what is available medically as treatment or prevention and through our behaviour as prevention. The basic message about lifestyle remains the same, regardless of what the medicine can do, in that respect.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I feel your comments about evolution are a little harsh. Surely it can't be just a matter of numbers and survival otherwise, surely, we'd all still be cavemen?! It must be that evolution is about change and adaptability and that's where hope lies, in being able to learn. We have evolved this far and can solve far more complex problems than we could before and cancer is on the list. Your own closing paragraph appears to point to this when you say 'we reap the benefits of the work and sacrifices of our ancestors'.

Now I&#039;m into my third month of mine, I understand what a difficult question that is. I had conversation with one of my supervisors right at the start of my studies about how life was often a question of how much uncertainty one could live with. My opinion being that uncertainty leads to feelings of not being in control which leads to feelings of powerlessness. And feelings of powerlessness leads to feelings of anger or depression. Hence the illusion of certainty and being in control of ones destiny is very necessary for sanity even if it is a great big fat lie. So to be asked about my PhD frequently triggers that lovely chain of emotions in me as I find it difficult to frame my thoughts about what I&#039;m doing in any coherent way much of the time. </p>
<p>So I&#039;ve been trying to write this for about three weeks now in the hope it linearises my thoughts and makes them just a bit more manageable.</p><p>The quantity of jargon involved is one thing that makes it tough to talk/write about and therefore it is quite a mission to explain things in plain English. I&#039;ll do my best to explain as I go, but it inevitably ends up quite lengthy as a consequence.</p>
<p>John the laconic man from North Carolina who has the desk next to me and is both my colleague and unwitting mentor in my blind stagger into academia has two catchphrases: &quot;Here&#039;s the deal...&quot; and (usually directed to me) &quot;I&#039;ll leave that as an exercise for the Reader...&quot;</p>
<p>So here&#039;s the deal: My supervisor Tim, a Professor in Immunology has spent much of the last 10 years trying to understand the mechanisms by which cells present signals to our immune systems to indicate whether they are healthy or not. This is in order to better understand how our bodies observe (or not) cancer cells with a view to improving these processes and preventing cancers. My last post gives some more background and detail to all that.</p>
<p>At present I&#039;m involved a sort of mini-project to&#160;improve the understanding of&#160;these mechanisms inside the cells of chickens by modelling the structures of unknown immune system proteins with a known similar protein.&#160;This approach is to compare <a href="http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?action=Search+OMD&amp;query=protein" target="_blank">proteins</a> and trace their evolutionary heritage in order to identify the changes that have taken place. DNA is the molecule that encodes all the biological information that describes life. </p><p>I&#160;still find it a&#160;mind blowing concept to think that all&#160;life - you, me, dogs, trees,&#160;bacteria - everything, are all related. Or to put it another way - Unifying Biochemistry underlies the diversity of Biological Life. And don&#039;t take my word for it, that is what the evidence tell us, have a read and check it out.</p>
<p>So one can imagine that if one can look&#160;around today&#160;and make comparisons&#160;it&#039;s possible to trace the changes through time, this is called phylogenetics - I believe a guy called Darwin had&#160;a similar&#160;idea and&#160;though he didn&#039;t have access to DNA to and modern statistical methods&#160;support his ideas he still made a compelling case that is still the cause of controversy for people who aren&#039;t big fans of evidence.</p><p>DNA essentially is a code - like these words - it can be read and used to do something as well as having a physical form (in the case of DNA the form of an acid and in the case of these words in the form of electricity and/or light). The code is written as genes (about 25,000 in humans) and what DNA does a lot of the time is to provide codes for building proteins.</p>
<p>I&#039;m building models of Chicken Immune system protein complexes called the major histocompatibility complex. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a protein complex (i.e. it contains several proteins) that exists in all jawed mammals inside cells. It&#039;s role is to present to the immune system cells (that are roaming around between the other cells) protein fragments called peptides that tell the body whether there is disease present inside that cell. Each human carries around 6 different types of them (different types of the same thing are called alleles) as a consequence of evolution, while their are thought to be more than 20 different alleles in total in humans. Different alleles recognise and present different diseases. </p><p>The hope is that it&#039;s possible to identify the important bits of these Chicken alleles - the bits that determine what diseases are presented by cells to the immune system - by looking at what has changed and what has not changed between the structures. Below is a representation of the known protein from a Chickens Immune system on the left and one of my final models on the right in blue. We&#039;re not interested in the yellow part, hence I&#039;ve not modelled it.</p>

<p>If you&#039;ve got this far, you&#039;re probably wondering what the Chicken has to with fighting Cancer in Humans. A question I often ask myself.It&#039;s not a very simple answer<span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Arial;">:</span></p><p><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-family:Trebuchet MS;"> The reasons for using
Chicken MHC molecules is the suggestion that unlike in humans there has
been co-evolution between the interacting genes involved in this part of their immune system</span></span><span><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">. This possibility means it should be easier to identify
significant co-evolved mutations in Chickens and thus sites that are important to how these protein complexes present information regarding the health of the cells they correspond to. Identification of these sites in Chicken MHC
would then assist in the identification of the corresponding sites in Human MHC
Class I molecules and thus may shed light on how diseases are presented to the human immune system. <br /></span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">Essentially then it&#039;s a strategy for working backwards to cross reference the biochemical unity by analysing one species proteins in which we think the relevant genes that code them are close together in the genome and using the results to find the relevant genes in another - Us - that are not sitting side by side on our genome (25,000 genes remember). And if you know where the code is - you can start messing about with it - wreaking terrible havoc or curing diseases! </span></span>
</p><p>The next step&#160; for me is to model the structure of another associated protein and then hopefully to do some dynamic modelling to see how these two proteins interact. </p><p>That&#039;s probably more than enough about that, but suffice to say it&#039;s really difficult and complicated and hence my opening paragraphs. If you really want to learn more about how it&#039;s all done then as an exercise for the Reader have a look <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/About/primer/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>I&#039;m due to go to Microsoft sometime in January and start a whole other side of things. Here&#039;s a quote from my supervisor Andrew:</p><p><em>&quot;We are developing programming languages and tools for simulating and
analysing complex models of biological systems. One of our aims is to
develop a language in which large models of biological systems can be
programmed from simple components in a modular fashion. The ultimate
goal is to be able to program and test a biological system on a
computer, before implementing the final design inside a living organism.&quot;</em></p><p><em><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/biology/default.aspx" target="_blank">Programming Biology, Microsoft Research, 2008</a></em></p><p><em>--------------------------------------------------------<br /></em></p>
<p>Changing tack: on the cultural front I&#039;ve been to see several great films in the last few months -<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/oct/10/crime" target="_blank"> Gomorra </a>and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/nov/21/waltz-with-bashir-folman" target="_blank">Waltz with Bashir</a> stand out. Not exactly reassuring about humanity in general, but excellent nonetheless.</p><p>TV has been a dead zone as usual, with the exception of the IT Crowd. I&#039;m making my way through the final series of Battlestar Galactica on DVD, but my heart isn&#039;t really in it. Like many series, it&#039;s gone on too long and just got stupid.</p><p>I went to see the Francis Bacon exhibition and I liked that a lot, especially the 1950&#039;s blue paintings themed around apprehension (yeah, what a surprise!) but it was very crowded. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Books I&#039;ve recently read and rated: </span><a href="http://www.jamessallis.com/" target="_blank"><br /></a></p><p><a href="http://www.jamessallis.com/" target="_blank">James Sallis&#039;s</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cripple-Creek-James-Sallis/dp/1842432346/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1229635984&amp;sr=1-7" target="_blank">Cripple Creek</a> was fantastic.

I don&#039;t normally go in for this kind of thing either - storytelling/social commentary songs - but he made me laugh several times (A few words in defence of our country, especially) and Feels Like Home and Potholes are just great songs.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dont-You-Evah-Album-version/dp/B001F371M6/ref=sr_f2_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dmusic&amp;qid=1230565772&amp;sr=102-1" target="_blank">Don&#039;t You Evah</a> by Spoon is probably my favourite song of 2008.</p><p>That&#039;s it for this year then.

<br /></span></span></p><p style="font-size:12px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">This
is going to be lengthy and hard going, but I&#039;ll try to make it as
understandable and relevant to you the reader as possible.(And if anyone
reading this wishes to ask for clarifications or give me feedback on what is
not clear or just plain incorrect, that would be quite useful for me.)</span></span>
</p><p style="font-size:12px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">I&#039;m
now over a month into my PhD and I thought I&#039;d write something of what I&#039;m
doing, how I&#039;m doing it and ultimately what it&#039;s all for. Which would be easier
if I had some idea of it myself...ok here we go...the keyword here is <strong><em>partition</em></strong>.
I several different partitions in my head, yet they are all connected:
Immunology, Biochemistry, Cancer Sciences and Computing.</span></span></p>
<p style="font-size:12px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">The human immune system is a remarkable
thing and can, in theory, see off any pathogen it encounters. A pathogen being
any disease inducing micro organism e.g. a virus like the common cold, bacteria
like salmonella, a parasite like roundworms or a &#039;self&#039; pathogen such as
cancer.</span></span></p>
<p style="font-size:12px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">However the immune system is a product
of evolution and as most people know evolution is simply a selection mechanism
for ensuring the survival of a population of organisms long enough so that it
can reproduce a new generation. Hence it is often &#039;good enough&#039; in its
solutions to ensure survival of a species and as a consequence &#039;improvements&#039;
often get conserved and passed along. But it is not a system for designing the
best solution to a problem in the way an engineer would.</span></span></p>
<p style="font-size:12px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">This is an explanation for why we get
cancers, allergies, diabetes etc. perhaps even mental illnesses. These are all
the imperfections that affect us as individuals (often terribly) but affect the
entire population in such a way as to give us a shot at sticking around long
enough to have children.</span></span></p>
<p style="font-size:12px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">Most of us are also familiar with
vaccinations. This is where a &#039;safe&#039; version of a microbe is introduced to the
immune system to stimulate it to produce the necessary weapons in preparation
for a real attack. This was the first real success medical science had in
manipulating the immune system to work more effectively.</span></span></p>
<p style="font-size:12px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">Vaccines essentially work as what is
called an antibody mediating approach to immunity. That is to say that
antibodies (target finders if you wish) tell the body what a foreigner looks
like and then to kill it. The body can deal with some foreigners relatively
easily when evolution has had lots of experience selecting for them and they
are not too dangerous - like a dodgy bacteria infested kebab or a cold virus
stuck in your nose. But a lot of things we’ve either never seen before or are
less easy to deal with and more dangerous such as a polio or measles virus,
which is why we need vaccines to pick up where evolution left off by priming us
to have antibodies that can recognise these pathogens.</span></span></p>
<p style="font-size:12px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">However our bodies are made of cells
and viruses and cancers exist inside the cells and pretend they are part of us.
The immune system needs a way to be able to distinguish between &#039;self&#039; and
&#039;non-self&#039; when selecting what to kill. This is called cellular immunity which
is what my work is really all about.</span></span></p>
<p style="font-size:12px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">Essentially, all our cells have
internal mechanisms for sampling the chemicals inside each cell and sending
them to the surface so that the immune system cells can roam around the body
surveying the surface of the cells for anything untoward. If it finds something
it shouldn&#039;t i.e. a cell with a chemical on the surface indicating a virus
inside it then sends it a message to commit suicide and the cell dies.</span></span></p>
<p style="font-size:12px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">Cancer cells are our own cells - they
are &#039;self&#039; except they are &#039;self&#039; gone wrong. They are cells that multiply grow
out of control either killing us by causing our vital organs not to function
any more or from lack of red blood cells that provide oxygen to our organs if
it is leukaemia.</span></span></p>
<p style="font-size:12px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">The immune system has evolved to
distinguish between &#039;self&#039; and &#039;non-self&#039; to prevent it attacking our own
bodies, attacking ourselves is called auto-immunity. However in the case of
cancer it would obviously be desirable if the immune system did attack these
cells and to some extent it does do this. In fact doctors are always interested
in those apocryphal people who&#039;ve &quot;</span><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">smoked
40 a day for 60 years and never did me any harm</span><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">&quot; because they may have
something special about their immune system and that is why it never did them
any harm.</span></span></p>
<p style="font-size:12px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">If you&#039;ve made it this far - that&#039;s
some of the background - here&#039;s where I get to talk about what I&#039;m doing:</span></span></p>
<p style="font-size:12px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">Returning to the idea that our cells
have internal mechanisms for selecting peptide fragments for presentation on
the surface - that is to say molecules called proteins made from carbon, nitrogen,
hydrogen, oxygen, sulphur and phosphorus. What&#039;s truly remarkable is that these
six elements can combine to produce a very very large number of different
proteins (millions and millions). So the body has to have a way of selecting
which ones are important and therefore to present. There is not enough time or
energy for an effective immune response without some selection. It appears that
the peptides presenting cancer are generally not strongly presented and
therefore these cells often go unnoticed.</span></span></p>
<p style="font-size:12px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">This mechanism is the heart of the
problem and understanding it could ultimately lead to vaccines for cancer. In
other words, in the same way that the immune system is prompted to produce the
weapons needed to fight measles by the introduction of a deactivated measles
virus to the body, a chemical that aids the presentation of the peptides that
say &#039;I&#039;m a cancer cell&#039; would act as a vaccine by prompting the immune system
to destroy it before it could do any real damage.</span></span></p>
<p style="font-size:12px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">Understanding the mechanism is very difficult
though. These molecules are made of many atoms and their function is determined
through their shape as well as their composition. The process itself is dynamic
and yet much of the information can only be gathered by means which are the
equivalent of taking a few still pictures and trying to make a film out of
them.</span></span></p>
<p style="font-size:12px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">What I’ve been doing in this last two
weeks then is trying to understand how to model the 3D structure of a molecular
complex that is involved in this presentation process from its chemical
sequence. This is done by comparison to known molecules and using the laws of physics to try and determine the shape it will take.The pictures at the top are my first attempts to do this. It really
is working down at the atomic level and wasn’t what I expected I’d being doing
at this point, but it’s all part of the overall problem. Welcome to my world of
bioinformatics and biochemistry. The three images here are from my first bit of modelling (click on them to see them full size): They show a template molecule for which a structure is known on the left, while the other two are the same modelled molecule
displayed in two ways – one as a ‘ribbon’ cartoon to show various functional components
of the molecule and one as a ‘space-filling’ cartoon which indicates something
of how it might really look if you could see it. It’s so small I can&#039;t think of an analogy to compare it to. Those lines coming off the model mean I still need to refine this model for it to be approaching a real molecule.</span></span></p>
<p style="font-size:12px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">The point of this is that by
understanding the structures one can start to understand the dynamic process.
As I say, shape is conveying information as much as what it’s made of – think
‘thumbs up’ versus ‘the middle finger’ - they mean quite different things.
Fundamentally it is all an information problem to my mind.</span></span></p>
<p style="font-size:12px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">I’m now based over in Biochemistry
having left the Hospital for a few months to do this, which is like some kind of
old Nuclear Power Station, grey concrete with a maze of corridors. It does have
an amazing view though. I can see the Isle of Wight from the window on a clear
day.</span></span></p>
<p style="font-size:12px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"></p><p style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">A digression for the nerds – although
I’m part sponsored by Microsoft and will be writing the Pi Calculus code under
their guidance, the Biochemists are all on Unix, while some of the Cancer
Sciences people run their analysis systems on Macs! It’s a good thing I
regard computers just as machines like spoons or anything else – but another set of is partitions
needed. I will say that I have been enjoying getting back to Linux, there is
something really satisfying about the feeling of control one has when running
things from the command line inside a shell and writing little scripts to tweak things just
the way I need. It’s what I don’t like about the proprietorial systems, however
beautiful their interface may be, I’m doing what they want which isn’t
necessarily what I want. Though in the interests of full disclosure, I did have
to spend half a day reinstalling Linux to get the laptop I’m borrowing running
with Fedora, while the Vista partition booted no problem, so there’s no perfect
answer. And unlike Mac or Windows things rarely &#039;just work&#039;. And for the uber-nerds I’m writing Python scripts at
the moment to do this modelling.</p><p><span style="font-size:12pt;"></span>
</p><p style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><p style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">This probably sounds like it’s all
going swimmingly, but on the emotional front this has all been exhausting and
I’ve been arriving home depressed most nights for two weeks at just how out of
my depth I am and how little I’ve achieved each day (plus ca change, eh?). And
I’m in an office now, a proper office. If there’s one thing I’d hoped to avoid
in my life it was an office job. Basically, I’m sat there with a laptop, a pile
of textbooks and the realisation that there is not enough coffee in the world
to make my brain work fast enough. ‘What have I done?’ followed by ‘Your choice
idiot and you’re incredibly lucky, so suck it up and show some adaptability.’
is the usual conversation I have with myself each night...</p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><p style="font-size:13px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">If and when I get to grips with the Biochemistry,
I then have to cross partitions to modelling at a higher level (the realm of
cells rather than atoms) and potentially I’ll do some wet work too. I’ll save
those details for another time. Who knows? Years down the line it may all
ultimately feed into drug trials and improved cancer treatments. </p></span></p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Al, bit late on this - your warning of '1500 words' was warning enough to put me off reading the post until I had plenty of good time.
Anyway, very concise and informative as usual; you really are very good at explaining complex things in an 'everyday' manner. (To be nitpicky/nerdy, watch your syntax; little words missed out make sentences difficult to read, e.g. 'They are cells that multiply AND grow out of control ---&gt; killing us EITHER by causing our vital organs not to function any more or from lack of red blood cells that provide oxygen to our organs if it is leukaemia.' Sorry, twiddly, I know but your clarity is exemplary otherwise. And I know I'm far from prefect.
Great pictures: the molecule looks like lots of men clustered together wearing very tight underpants.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/9cc3f-6a00d8348a3d9b69e2010535819ed7970b-pi.jpg" style="display:inline;"><img alt="Vest" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e2010535819ed7970b image-full " src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/9cc3f-6a00d8348a3d9b69e2010535819ed7970b-pi.jpg" style="width:85px;height:114px;" title="Vest" /></a>
<br />As a matter of staying sane, I try to not think about what people may be saying about me behind my back. In fact, I&#039;m a bit like a small child in that I pretend that if I&#039;m not there I don&#039;t exist for anyone else and I&#039;m usually surprised if someone I meet says they&#039;ve heard something about me - but today&#039;s revelation was a whole new level of weirdness:</p><p>I went into the Cancer Sciences Division building after lunch today and one of my new colleagues came up to me and said, &#039;There&#039;s a rumour going around the department that you used to work for MI5. Is this true?&#039;</p><p>Of course the only appropriate response was to say that I could neither confirm or deny any involvement I may or may not have had in the past or the present with the Secret Services...</p><p>A bit later I met someone else I&#039;d never met before, who took one look at me and said, &#039;Are you the Engineer?&#039; Now that&#039;s a bit more like it. Thought my cover was slipping for a moment.</p><p>So anyway, I&#039;m definitely not in Kansas any more. My induction goes on until Friday and I&#039;m starting to think PowerPoint should be a Health and Safety issue, if it&#039;s not an actual abuse of my human rights. I&#039;ve lost count of how many hours I&#039;ve sat through and I really don&#039;t want to slag the process off, but I think they need to rethink the whole induction thing a bit. For me personally it&#039;s mostly serving to scare me as to how much I don&#039;t know and everyone else is pretty bored. There is something very passive about sitting through a PowerPoint presentation which unless it&#039;s really good (which is the exception) it&#039;s not a particularly good way to engage a group of people in my opinion. And I get the impression that most people presenting don&#039;t seem to get that unless a speaker is really gifted, most people switch off after a couple of minutes. Much like me typing this, if it&#039;s dull you won&#039;t have read this far!</p><p>Something I didn&#039;t explain last time, the Faculty of Life Sciences took in about 100 post-graduate students who I saw on the first morning. The School of Medicine took on about 35 of these, with whom I spent a week and as of last Thursday we&#039;re down the 6 of us in Cancer Sciences Division and from Monday, I&#039;ll be on my own doing my PhD.</p><p>The best thing I learnt on my induction so far (and props to my colleague Lyndsey for this) was that if one is falling asleep in a presentation/meeting, lift both feet off the floor. It forces one to contract all one&#039;s core muscles so one has to concentrate.&#160;</p><p>I&#039;ve been sitting through presentations on a whole range of stuff to do with Medical Research which I don&#039;t understand enough about to write about, but I really liked the one on Imaging where the guy showed us lots of cool pictures and told us how our brains interpret images and can be fooled, while explaining the different machines we can use. We had to wear 3D glasses for some of the images.</p><p>I&#039;ll be glad when it&#039;s done, but it doesn&#039;t detract from what I said last time about knowing how lucky I am. I&#039;m looking forward to being a bit more active (once I get rid of this Freshers Flu).</p><p>Which segue ways nicely into mentioning the picture above of the running vest I wore for my first cross country race in four years. We look like the Southampton Football team out for a run. It was a beautiful autumn day up near Winchester and I came in 143rd out of 269 runners in 37m42s over the 9km. I&#039;m very happy with that as a start and hope to move up the field as the season progresses. I&#039;m not a particularly competitive person, but it&#039;s good to have training goals.</p><p>On the reading and watching front I&#039;ve been getting into my Women&#039;s Science Fiction again. I&#039;m about a third of the way into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Female_Man" target="_blank">The Female Man by Joanna Russ</a> and while I can see what a great book it is, it&#039;s such hard work because of the non-linear narrative style and trick of changing storyteller perspective mid-way through a paragraph,I doubt I&#039;m gonna finish it.</p><p>Much easier reading and therefore more enjoyable for my tired brain is <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bold-As-Love-Gollancz-S-F/dp/057507292X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1224013913&amp;sr=8-2" target="_blank">Bold as Love</a> by <a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/gwynethann/" target="_blank">Gwyneth Jones</a>. If it finishes as strongly as it&#039;s started it may well be one of my favourites of the year. All about a young woman musician during a future dissolution of the United Kingdom. Funny and moving so far.</p><p>I&#039;ve got another <a href="http://www.justinarobson.co.uk/" target="_blank">Justina Robson</a> book waiting for me too.</p><p>And last night I went to see <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/124741/i.ve.loved.you.so.long" target="_blank">I&#039;ve Loved You So Long</a>. Which I thought was great. A proper old school Art Film. I&#039;m sure my former lecturer would say there was too much talking and not enough story telling through pictures, but it was a little in the traditon of Eric Rohmer (to which it refers) and was a really powerful story about two sisters. And family. And love. The standard stuff of life. No car chases or special effects.</p><p>Right, better go clean my Walther PPK before bed, I don&#039;t want to get in trouble with <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/09/18/illuminati_black_op/" target="_blank">Director Womack</a>...</p><p></p><p></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is really a post for myself (well they all are, but this more so) to try and make some sense of the chaos in my head after the last week.<br />I woke up this morning primed to get up and run the 12 miles on my training schedule and clear my head and while I don&#039;t mind the rain, it&#039;s too heavy and windy to consider yet. And so I&#039;ve ended up wasting my morning stressing about things I can&#039;t control like I know I shouldn&#039;t. Maybe I can run later, this will do in the meantime.</p><p>Anyway, I&#039;ve had a week of induction for my PhD and I still have two weeks to go. I was exhausted come Friday and not a little overwhelmed by the experience, as well as daunted by what is still to come.</p><p>First of all, despite feeling pretty grumpy after about 10 Power point presentations on Monday, when I was walking to the hospital on day two on Wednesday I did find myself considering just how privileged I am. People are paying me to learn stuff, that&#039;s got to make me one of the luckiest people alive and I wonder how many of my colleagues feel the same? Having done some pretty rubbish jobs and had some pretty awful experiences in my time, I am one lucky person, no doubt. However it feels.</p><p>Induction is like peeling an onion. Day One started with the all of the Life Sciences Faculty new Post-Graduates first thing at the Boldrewood Campus. So that was people from Medicine, Nursing, Bio-Sciences, Psychology, Biology etc. I was pleasantly surprised to see Liz there, who started on Civil Eng with me, so it wasn&#039;t an entire room of strangers. And I&#039;d gone in with the hope meeting one person I could get along with, so I&#039;d achieved that goal straight away.</p><p>After a couple of hours of Power Point, we got sent off to our respective Schools within the Faculty. I&#039;ve been assigned to Medicine, even though I&#039;m really as much a part of Biochemistry and Computer Science in what I&#039;ll be doing. So that&#039;s the next layer of the onion.</p><p>Over at the General Hospital is where the School of Medicine is based. The next sessions (of Power Point, did I mention they use Power Point a lot yet?) were then consisting of people doing Medical Research: Nutritionists, Medical Doctors, Cancer Scientists etc. We started with the usual Health and Safety stuff and overview of the School (which is huge) then had a tour and that was it for the day. And I met another nice person.</p><p>Tuesday was International Student Day, so I didn&#039;t have to attend and took the opportunity to do other chores.</p><p>Wednesday was the start of the School Induction proper. Lots more presentations/lectures about what research is all about, how to develop a hypothesis. Most interesting that day was the session on the Ethics of Human Research. </p><p>This gave me a chance to hear from my new colleagues how they think a bit. It made me think (not for the first time) that everyone should have the opportunity to experience working/mixing with people in fields outside their own. That again speaks to my feeling of privilege. I&#039;ve attended Art school and mixed with people from that background, I&#039;ve worked and studies with Engineers/Physicists and Mathematicians and now I&#039;m mixing with people from the Medical world. It really opens my mind each time I hear how different people experience and understand the world.&#160;</p><p>In this instance we had to look at and discuss an AIDs prevention study in South Africa. In the discussion what struck me most was that while my instincts are more technical - how do we make sure it&#039;s worthwhile and done properly/safely? - much of what other people were saying was more immediately human - concerns about dignity of the participants for example. Aiming for the same things, but coming at them from a different perspective.</p><p>The next day we had an Animal Ethics lecture, which was to me the most sobering and interesting session of the first week. Following on from the more generalised discussion about human ethics, to use an American expression this one really went to where the rubber meets the road. I found it quite moving in some respects as the speaker talked about the dilemmas of killing animals to save humans. It certainly left me in no doubt, whatever your views on animal experimentation, it is something that is thought about in great detail by those involved and not taken lightly in any aspect. She talked about pain alleviation, sentience of the animals involved, licensing, differing cultural attitudes towards animals and how decisions are made as to proceeding with any proposed experiments. I was surprised to discover that all medication in this country has to be tested on animals prior to licensing - some to think about when you next have a cold or headache - some creature died to make sure that you don&#039;t when you pop that pill. And unlike modern human research, they didn&#039;t get to chose to participate.</p><p>For me personally, I&#039;ll be building a tool that one day, if successful, may be used to design drugs. So it&#039;s given me a lot to think about in terms of the possible consequences of my actions following this path. As an engineer, one is always made to consider the consequences of messing up and designing for that. This is different. </p><p>Many of the rest of the sessions this week have been about dealing with Administration involved in doing research and techniques of searching literature and developing skills related to written work in research such as avoiding plagiarism. To be fair, dull as it often has been listening to that stuff, it does demonstrate the great efforts they make to help us get started.</p><p>Next week, I have three more days introducing me to a whole bunch of stuff actually about medicine and biology such as an overview of stem cell research. That&#039;s where I&#039;m getting daunted. I have a to repeat, &#039;Don&#039;t Panic&#039; in my head several times a day when I remember how much I don&#039;t know and need to learn. So many known unknowns, let alone all the unknown unknowns.</p><p>Then on Thursday, I reach the third layer of the onion and head off to my Division within the School within the Faculty within the University for more induction. Confused yet? I know I am.&#160;</p><p>My Division is Cancer Sciences and I can see I&#039;ve got more Health and Safety and a whole load of lab induction stuff for example - fusion protein tools - whatever that is. Still trying to get my head around the definition of a protein. </p><p>That takes me through to the 17th of October and if I haven&#039;t leapt from the Itchen Bridge in despair by that point I might actually start doing some work on my PhD itself.</p><p>It&#039;s taken me hour to write that and it&#039;s stopped raining, so I can finally go out and run. Yay! And actually it does make a bit more sense now I&#039;ve typed it up.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/3f835-6a00d8348a3d9b69e2010534c941d1970c-pi.jpg" style="display:inline;"><img alt="Luynes" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e2010534c941d1970c image-full " src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/3f835-6a00d8348a3d9b69e2010534c941d1970c-pi.jpg" style="width:107px;height:80px;" title="Luynes" /></a>
</p><p>This picture is more or less how I remember the summer of 2008. Grey. Still, at least I had a proper holiday this year. A week camping in France.</p><p>I&#039;ve just about finished moving home for the first time in four years - which was a lot more hassle than I thought, but on the whole an improvement so far - and on Monday I begin my induction to the School of Medicine. It still has an air of unreality about it when I write that and I&#039;d completely forgotten I&#039;d even got a degree until someone at work asked me a few days ago if I&#039;d finished it yet.</p><p>Medicine - it&#039;s one of the last areas I&#039;d have expected to end up working four years ago or even 20 years ago. </p><p>But, for better or worse I start a PhD on Monday and I&#039;m getting pretty nervous about it. I was advised to get two textbooks to start with on Molecular Biology (each over 1000 pages) and so far I&#039;m about 100 pages into one of them. I&#039;m not sure how soon I need to be up to speed&#160; with that stuff, but I&#039;ve also got to start learning the programming language too. Definite feeling that I&#039;m unprepared, standing at the bottom of a mountain and trying to convince myself that it&#039;s just a bunch of small steps repeated to get to the top! </p><p>The weirdest thing has been visiting the hospital a couple of times and realising that this is to be a place of work for me soon. I&#039;m hoping I become desensitised to going there as I felt really uncomfortable both times I&#039;ve been so far.</p><p>There&#039;s quite a lot of lectures too - introductions to electron microscopy, modules on statistics in medicine, that sort of thing. Which I&#039;m looking forward to doing. New stuff is usually fun.</p><p>I have had a fair bit of time for reading over the summer and I&#039;ve read a general introductory book on Immunology which has been really interesting so I expect to find the subject enjoyable on that level - lots of facts like how mothers kissing babies helps their children&#039;s immune system that I&#039;ve been boring anyone who&#039;ll listen with - but it is mind blowing in it&#039;s complexity. Which is kind of the point of the PhD - getting a handle on the complexity so it is manageable and understandable and can be put to use.</p><p>Not a lot else to say really. Did a calculation a few weeks back where I estimated I spent 85-90% of the time in an average week over the summer on my own, which was slightly surprising even to me. Not read any really great books (except <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/I-Am-Legend-S-F-Masterworks/dp/1857988094/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1222200588&amp;sr=8-2" target="_blank">I am Legend</a> which is so good I read it in a day), just a bunch of average ones and likewise with films. See the side bar for links.</p><p>I&#039;m intending to join a running club for the cross country season and that&#039;s my only new plan at the moment. I&#039;ve missed doing that in the last few years, but I&#039;ve often been working on Saturdays.</p><p>Actually, I only got the confirmation of funding through last Friday and so I&#039;m not officially doing a PhD until I sign and return the offer form, so I&#039;ve still got time to change my mind...</p><p></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a style="display:inline;" href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/88626-6a00d8348a3d9b69e200e5539a492c8834-120wi.jpg"><img style="width:89px;height:131px;" class="at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e200e5539a492c8834 " alt="StreetSign" src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/88626-6a00d8348a3d9b69e200e5539a492c8834-120wi.jpg"></a>&nbsp;</p><p>The above picture is of a street sign in Southampton that I saw last week and had to take a picture of. I thought I was so jaded that nothing could surprise me, but this managed to make me laugh. I didn't realise that this society had become quite so insane that we need calorie counts on our street signs, but I was obviously wrong. Definitely a sign of the times if you'll excuse the awful pun.</p><p>There's a sentence in The Left Hand of Darkness that goes something along the lines of that while it's good to have a destination, it's the journey itself that is most important. And so it has been with the last four years and so I find it difficult to sum up my feelings about this period on arrival at this point in any simple way as they are somewhat conflicted. But for my own record I should say something. It has been really hard work, most days I've questioned what the hell am I doing and I'm so used to things going badly it's kind of disorientating to succeed. I didn't really realise how much it mattered to me to get a first until I was walking down to pick up my results and I started to feel like I wanted to puke and once I saw the bit of paper it was mostly relief that I felt. In terms of overall lessons learned then I'd return to two of my favourite mantras of recent years, Louis Pasteur's, "Fortune favours the prepared mind" and my paraphrasing of running writer Arthur Newtons advice, "You are only fit for for what you do". This is because in my experience hard work and determination combined with a willingness to reflect, learn and adapt when faced with one's mistakes/faults will make up for a lack of talent in many situations. Although this usually gets distilled down to the words 'Suck it up!'&nbsp; playing on a loop in my mind when things get tough and I have the urge to give in.</p><p>Another benefit I find of doing a science based subject is that it regularly serves to remind me of my own insignificance in the scheme of things either numerically or in terms of the relative nature of the problems that I face in my daily life. I'm far too self-indulgent as it is and so it's useful for me to have a counter balance. Speaking of self-indulgence, time keeps on moving forward whether I like it or not and so to the future...</p><p>Last Tuesday after I got my results I went for an interview for a PhD over in the Biological Sciences department and I've since accepted the offer to do a PhD with them starting in October. This probably sounds quite bizarre after all this time spent in Engineering and in some respects it is I suppose, but it seemed like such an unusual opportunity (arising from a discussion in the pub) that I thought I'd regret it if I turned it down. I'll try to explain it as best I can, but even the supervisors are not sure what I'm exactly likely to end up with a PhD in!</p><p>I know next to nothing about immunology, but from the little background reading I've done since this PhD was proposed to me what I understand is that our body has cells that can act as police going around killing (among others) cells that are infected with cancer. However for these killer cells (Cytotoxic T-cells) to kill cancer cells they need to be able to recognise the cancer cells and they can only do this when they present in certain ways. Researchers have been trying to develop ways to force cancer cells present themselves to our bodies immune system so that our own bodies can kill the cancer with these killer T-cells by influencing the way the cancer cells develop - essentially interfering in the process with drugs - but in order to do this they need to understand the process by which cells are encoded to present themselves either as infected or not infected to the T-cells, which is still mostly a mystery. Still with me?! It's time to change disciplines.</p><p>Over in Computer Science, researchers have been trying to develop languages to describe and model systems which act as networks. I guess everyone has some concept of what a network is these days, whether it's a railway network, the internet or a group of people. More concisely though it can be described a system of concurrent processes.</p><p>The immune system is also a kind of network and therefore in theory it should be possible to model it using a language developed for other things like a mobile phone network. At present the Biological Science researchers have begun to develop a model of how infected cancer cells present and gathered some data based on in vivo lab experiments. While separately the computer science researchers have developed the language and begun developing a corresponding model in the computer. What they both need is someone to train up and work full time across both disciplines in order to take this work forward and develop both the lab and computer experiments. And that's the role I'll be taking on and why it's such an unusual and interesting opportunity. I'll be inducted to work in three locations, the Southampton General Hospital in the laboratory doing biological experiments and at the Southampton University Campus and up at a Computer Research Centre in Cambridge doing computer modelling. </p><p>The aim of the game then is to develop a model in which what is observed in the lab with real cells can be simulated in the computer like for like and then ultimately to start developing some kind of predictive model for guiding the development, in a speedier and more systematic way, of drugs that will help T-cells find the infected cancer cells and destroy them. Should be a piece of cake!</p><p>At which point I'll move onto Equality for Everyone, World Peace and then Time Travel of course, before tackling the really tough problems like making sure people don't drift into my path as if drawn to me magnetically when I'm trying to walk around them on the pavement... </p><p>Actually, it's pretty daunting just looking at the Introduction to Immunology textbook I bought today, but like I say I thought I'd regret if I didn't at least have a go, even if it's a disaster. The main selling points for me are that it is inter-disciplinary and as it is joint funded by the Medical Research Council and Microsoft, the money is confirmed and is a fair bit better than the Civil Engineering option. And all three of the supervisors seemed like really good people to work for/with which clinched the deal at the interview from my side. Hopefully it'll equip me with skills and knowledge that mean I'll be able to either get a job or carry on with more research at the end of the three or so years this will take. At the moment it's only a verbal confirmation and I suppose I shouldn't make too many plans until the paperwork is signed, but hopefully it'll all go through ok now.</p><p>So I've got a couple of months now to do some background reading, earn a bit of money, find somewhere new to live and I've got a stack of novels to read. Rather annoyingly now I have time to go to the cinema there is nothing on, so I guess I'll track down some things on DVD.</p><p></p><p> </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/a72b5-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201bb09dcb75e970d-500wi.jpg" style="display:inline;"><img alt="IMG_20171202_beaconhill" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201bb09dcb75e970d img-responsive" src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/a72b5-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201bb09dcb75e970d-500wi.jpg" title="IMG_20171202_beaconhill" /></a></p>
<p>It’s been so long since I wrote this as I find that when it comes to feelings very little changes. In fact, it’s kind of remarkable how little difference I feel as I grow older. It’s like I’ve felt the same for as long as I can remember. I know I must have changed and be changing, but internally I don’t notice. It’s pretty disappointing – to paraphrase Tokyo Story.</p>
<p>So I thought I’d make an effort to write about what I’ve been doing instead. I’ve got ten months left of my three year research post in Southampton investigating the immune system. This project is unusual in that I’ve involved in all parts of it: the design of the experiments, performing the experiments and analysing and presenting the data. What’s nice about this (but challenging) is that I have intimate knowledge of the whole thing and all the problems. Most of the project has been about developing the methodology to actually do the project, both in terms of experiments and analysis, and while there will be some new immunological knowledge at the end, the real benefit will be felt by those that use these tools to build on this work. A larger project involving both Oxford and Southampton using patient cancer tumour samples has been funded by Cancer Research UK partly as a consequence of this project. I don’t get any personal benefit from that, just the warm glow of knowing that I’ve made my tiny indirect contribution to knowledge that may increase some peoples chances of surviving cancer in the future.</p>
<p>In thinking about my own future I’ve been working through the materials provided by <a href="https://80000hours.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">80,000 hours</a>. This is a number representing the length of the average career. It speaks to question I’ve been mulling since I was still in my 20s about what does it mean to make a meaningful contribution and “do some good”? One of the ironies of following their career guide was that biomedical researcher – my current job – was one that it suggested I pursue! For reasons I won’t go into, this may no longer be a viable option for me. But I have found 80,000 hours very helpful in thinking about this question, and the various ways that one can contribute beyond more obvious directions such as helping people by being a medical doctor or teacher.</p>
<p>One option it’s had me revisit is the “earning to give”, and taking <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the pledge to donate 10% of my income to charity.</a> This is the idea that one is likely do more good in the world by earning at a sufficiently high income that giving 10% away would save more lives than training to be a doctor would. This assumes one doesn’t become an arms trader or some such choice! I find it a really difficult concept, as it’s so abstract to think that giving thousands of pounds away for things like malaria nets, or just <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charity/givedirectly/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">directly giving money to the poorest people</a> (as I did last year) is the most helpful thing one could do. But the science suggests is that it is one of the best ways to actually help. And despite meaning less holidays or material goods in my life, I’d still be in the top 5% richest people in the world having given away 10% of my earnings. I still haven’t made the pledge, but I am seriously considering it. Over 20 years I could expect to have saved around 80 lives. As I’ll never see or know these 80 people it’s very intangible and doesn’t stroke my ego the way that experiencing the results of my actions would do.</p>
<p>I should clarify that there are big problems other than global health and poverty and therefore making a high impact contribution could, for example, mean pursing a career in policy or advocacy to promote equal rights, or a reduction in factory farming, or the challenges of climate change etc. etc. But giving away money is possibly the simplest thing that people like me can do that the evidence suggests will actually have an impact. I&#039;d also mention that the 80,000 hours site is excellent for all sorts of evidence based information about many aspects of work, such as how to develop better social skills or cold emailing prospective contacts. All things I could definitely improve upon.</p>
<p>Something else I’ve done in the last year, both for the selfish reasons described and less selfish, that helps people directly, is train to be a <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Data Carpentry</a>/<a href="https://software-carpentry.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Software Carpentry</a> Instructor. Since 2013 I’ve become a keen user of the statistical programming language R. And I’ve also become aware that many many people have data they are trying to make sense of, but don’t know how best to do it. These people can be anyone in any field. I’ve helped train Archaeologists and Physicists. Biologists and Social Scientists. And it’s really rewarding, learning and teaching other people. I&#039;ve always been much better at helping other people solve their problems than solving my own. Must be something to do with perspective.</p>
<p>Recently, I finally joined a social media network. Twitter. This was motivated partly by low level harassments at my intransigence around social media, and partly after attending a science conference in Dublin in September. There was a scientist from the US there called <a href="https://twitter.com/atulbutte" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Atul Butte</a>, calls himself a data parasite, and he gave an inspiring talk that pushed a few buttons in me. One was the criticism about how scientists do science to publish papers and not solve problems. But the main thrust was that scientists generate tons of data that never gets used to solve problems, but could be. He gave a couple of great examples about using publicly available date to identify how existing drugs could be re-targeted to use cancer, and how existing data could be used to identify markers of disease to which new drugs could be made. He also talked about twitter as a tool of the job, which is kind of a complicated subject in itself, but I figured I could try it out. Don’t expect too much action, but you can reach me here: <a href="https://twitter.com/alistair604" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@alistair604</a>.</p>
<p>And maybe I’ll have a stab at using some of that publicly available data too. For example, I was thinking about seeing whether new anti-parasitic targets could be identified from the all the data on worms that’s out there. If only there was more time and I had more energy. If anyone has any fun ideas for data analysis drop me a line.</p>
<p>I think at the moment my ideal job would be something along the lines of a job where I could still do research some of the time, and one where I could work with people, especially people who don&#039;t identify as using code, or are from backgrounds that don&#039;t traditionally think of computing as being for them (and yet probably use all sorts of devices and software all day long) to help them to develop the skills they need for the problems they are trying to solve. Possibly <a href="http://rse.ac.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Research Software Engineering</a>, but I&#039;m not sure academia is the path for me. I do think that data/coding skills are an equality issue, and if we&#039;re ever going to beat the idiots we need to give as many, and as diverse a range of people as possible the skills to gather and examine the data and figure out what the most important problems are and how we solve them.</p>
<p>Or I could just stay home with the Bibi cat. My neighbours cats Bibi and her sister Belle have decided they live here at least 50% of the time. After sticking her murder mittens into my neck she&#039;s snoozing, but it can only be a matter of time before she wakes up and creates havoc. (I&#039;m on a break in my experiment and don&#039;t have to be back at work until 7.30pm).</p>

<p>For those that are interested, one of the things I learnt&#160; whilst in Dublin about what’s hot in the area of science I work in is the drive for personalised medicine. This is really problematic as it involves gathering data about individuals in terms of genes, blood, stool samples, and real time data such as heart rate from wearable devices. This is potentially incredibly powerful in saving lives – it would be fantastic to spot symptoms of cancer or a stroke long before they happen, and to know which specific drug or intervention is best likely to work for you. However, it’s another step towards total surveillance and zero privacy. He’s an example about a geneticist I know. Her parents chose to have DNA genotyping for fun. And what they found out was that they both carried the same gene associated with dementia. This means she also has the gene because we get our copy from one of our parents. Therefore if they both have it, she’s guaranteed to have it. Point being, she’s been diagnosed with a risk of dementia without her consent because of data someone else (her parents) chose to gather. And that’s just a simple example of what can go wrong. Who’s storing this data? And what might they do with it? There are lots of risks as well as benefits to gathering all this information. Challenging times ahead.</p>
<p>Oh, and I bought a car a couple of weeks ago. 44 years old and my first car. Is that unusual in the UK? Not sure. I used it to go up to Beacon Hill near Winchester on Saturday from where I took the picture at the top.</p>

What car? Make and model, and colour please.
As ever, your blog is very interesting but what are you going to do/aim for in 10 months?
Despite your early remarks, you come across as very confident and sure about what you like and like to do.
Good luck in assimilating them into your life.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#039;s two bits from the book 2312 that I regularly think about: one is the comment that no useful thoughts occur between midnight and 5 am, and the other is pseudoiteration. This second concept is best illustrated in the following (edited) quote from the book about the character Wahram&#039;s relationship with habits and the pseudoiterative:</p>
<p><em>Habits begin to form at the very first repetition. After that there is a tropism toward repetition, for the patterns involved are defenses, bulwarks against time and despair...Wahram was very aware of this, having lived the process many times; so he paid attention to what he did when he traveled, on the lookout for those first repetitions that would create the pattern of that particular moment in his life...Too often in his past, meaninglessness had gnawed at the edges of things. He needed order, and a project; he needed habits...habits were not truly iterative but pseudoiterative. The pattern of the day might be the same, in other words, but the individual events fulfilling the pattern were always a little bit different. Thus there was both pattern and surprise, and this was Wahram’s desired state: to live in a pseudoiterative. But then also to live in a good pseudoiterative, an interesting one, the pattern constructed as a little work of art. No matter the brevity of the trip, the dullness of the terrarium or the people in it, it was important to invent a pattern and a project and pursue it with all his will and imagination. </em></p>
<p><em>2312<br /> Kim Stanley Robinson</em></p>
<p>The psuedoiterative came to mind again following lunchtime discussion about the fact I hadn&#039;t posted a blog in nearly a year, and my response that my life is repetitive in ways that are are indeed a defence against the world, but probably not very interesting to read about again and again. But then again, on reflection I do also seek out both pattern and surprise, so here&#039;s a round of the things that are new in my psuedoiterative world in the last year:</p>
<p><strong>Social media</strong></p>
<p>I finally signed up for Spotify as my only real foray into the world of social media, and have been amazed at just how good it is. One of my hobby&#039;s is to study, and I&#039;ve been doing <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science" target="_blank">Coursera Data Science</a> and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning" target="_blank">Machine Learning </a>Courses in the last 12 months so know a little bit about how Spotify works, but it really is excellent at finding music I like. And I make no comment on whether Spotify is good or bad for the music industry, but as a product that delivers music I want to hear it&#039;s really impressed me. If anyone wants to share music with me or listen to what I&#039;m listening to, drop me a line and I&#039;ll tell you how to find me. I&#039;m afraid I still have no real desire to join Facebook or Twitter, these aren&#039;t communities I feel I would be an active part of at the moment, and I&#039;m also concerned they&#039;d make connections that probably aren&#039;t good for me, and create itches that I&#039;d struggle to resist scratching.</p>
<p><strong>Books</strong></p>
<p>One book I&#039;m currently reading is&#160;<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Why-Does-Not-Have-Focus/dp/0500290954" target="_blank">Why It Does Not Have To Be In Focus</a> which examines 100 photos, largely from the last 20 years. It&#039;s perfect for me, as I can dip in and out rather than worry about reading from start to finish. Anyhow, I was drawn to it because my life largely Art-free these days, and I recalled how much I used to love photography (along with Films and TV). It&#039;s really reignited my love of the form and the process, and after discussion with a colleague who amazed me by revealing she&#039;s nearly at the end of 5 years of taking a photo a day, has recommended the <a href="https://www.fujifilm.eu/uk/products/digital-cameras/proenthusiast-fixed-lens" target="_blank">Fuji fixed lens cameras</a> to me as the closest digital cameras to analogue that are portable. They are quite pricey, but I might splash out and get back to taking some shots.</p>
<p>One of my favourite photo&#039;s of which I have a postcard version from many years ago is Nan Goldin&#039;s <a href="http://vintageincolor.tumblr.com/post/42341318108/anthony-by-the-sea-nan-goldin" target="_blank" title="Anthony by the sea">Anthony by the sea</a> shot in Brighton in 1979. I like this photo partly due to narcissism (I imagine it could be me in the picture and the ambivalence of the pose), partly because it captures Brighton the way I think of it, and partly because it reminds of Edward Hopper and his obsession with light, particularly <a href="http://www.edwardhopper.net/sun-in-an-empty-room.jsp" target="_blank" title="Sun in an empty room">Sun in an empty room</a> and <a href="http://www.edwardhopper.net/rooms-by-the-sea.jsp" target="_blank" title="Rooms by the sea">Rooms by the sea</a> which is something I share, particularly at this time of year.</p>
<p>On the fiction front, my favourite read so far this year is <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Uprooted-Naomi-Novik/dp/1447294149/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1476542861&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=uprooted+naomi+novik" target="_blank">Uprooted by Naomi Novik</a>. It&#039;s a sort of fairy tale, and one of those rare books that manages to work on many levels in terms of being fun, moving and making me think. I&#039;ve also really enjoyed <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ian-McDonald/e/B004N6ICSO/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1" target="_blank">Luna by Ian MacDonald</a>, The Masked City by <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Genevieve-Cogman/e/B00SMVOKIC/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1476543265&amp;sr=1-2-ent" target="_blank">Genevieve Cogman</a> and the latest <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Black-Widow-Jack-Parlabane-Thriller/dp/0802125735/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1476543306&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=christopher+brookmyre" target="_blank">Christopher Brookmyre</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Half-War-Shattered-Sea-Book/dp/0007550286/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1476543349&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=joe+abercrombie" target="_blank">Joe Abercrombie</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nemesis-Games-Book-5-Expanse/dp/0356504255/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1476543393&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=james+s+a+corey" target="_blank">James S.A. Corey</a> books.</p>
<p><strong>Films and TV</strong></p>
<p>I&#039;ve not been to the cinema this year! And I&#039;ve not watched many at home, of those I&#039;ve only seen a one films that I really liked as a piece of cinema which was <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00Z6RYTYA/ref=dv_web_wtls_list_pr_13" target="_blank">Girlhood</a>. Going back to the way I was taught to look at film, this fitted the definition of cinema in that so much is conveyed without words, in both the joy of friendship and the sadness of her situation. I highly recommend it. I also enjoyed <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0169ETZXS/ref=dv_web_wtls_list_pr_11" target="_blank">Sicario,</a>which while not in the same league as Girlhood was a pretty intense thriller/Western, albeit ridiculous, morally and politically dubious as these things usually are. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/What-We-Shadows-Jemaine-Clement/dp/B00V4YMCJS/ref=sr_1_1?s=instant-video&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1476546167&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=what+we+do+in+the+shadows" target="_blank">What we do in the shadows</a> is a particularly fine spin on the mockumentary genre if you need a laugh.</p>
<p>We&#039;ve signed up for Netflix too, and there&#039;s nothing new on there that I&#039;d say is particularly amazing - mostly cos I&#039;m old and have seen it all before - but I did enjoy the retro-fest of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(TV_series)" target="_blank">Stranger Things</a>. And there&#039;s lots of old stuff like Alan Partridge, Breaking Bad and classic films that makes it good value for money</p>
<p><strong>Holidays</strong></p>
<p>I&#039;ve been very lucky on the holiday front this year and had four short trips away: Wales twice, New York, and Scotland. South Wales in early spring was beautiful, we had a flat in an incredibly ugly block looking over the sea meaning both the view, sound and smell were fantastic. I took this one at sunset, the dog licked me:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/ba3e2-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201b7c8a03992970b-120wi.png" style="display:inline;"><img alt="Caswell_bay_2016" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201b7c8a03992970b img-responsive" src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/ba3e2-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201b7c8a03992970b-120wi.png" title="Caswell_bay_2016" /></a></p>
<p>Then I went back with Steve and family for a short, but excellent camping trip just along the coast in August. There&#039;s something about swimming in the sea that is just one of the best things a person can do, especially when it was me, Grace, Pearl and Steve with body boards too. There&#039;s an <a href="https://web.cs.dal.ca/~johnston/poetry/maggy.html">e.e cummings poem</a> that sums it up nicely. Here&#039;s a picture of the aftermath, with Stan chilling with Huey:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/d5ff3-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201b7c8a039d0970b-120wi.png" style="display:inline;"><img alt="Wales_camping_2016" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201b7c8a039d0970b img-responsive" src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/d5ff3-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201b7c8a039d0970b-120wi.png" title="Wales_camping_2016" /></a></p>
<p>And Huey could not get enough of the tennis ball:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/3b4f8-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201bb09436677970d-120wi.png" style="display:inline;"><img alt="Huey_2016" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201bb09436677970d img-responsive" src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/3b4f8-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201bb09436677970d-120wi.png" title="Huey_2016" /></a></p>
<p>New York was May, which wasn&#039;t the most relaxing of trips, but it&#039;s a great place to explore. And excellent vegan food too. I don&#039;t have any pictures that aren&#039;t anything like you can&#039;t Google.</p>
<p>Glasgow and Moray was September. We did a walking tour in Glasgow run by the <a href="http://www.gsa.ac.uk/visit-gsa/walking-tours/" target="_blank">School of Art</a>, which was excellent and again took me back to Art school days and that great feeling when someone makes you see something you never noticed before or in a new way. Then we went up to Culbin near Inverness in Moray. The drive through the Highlands itself was impressive, but <a href="http://culbinedge.co.uk/" target="_blank">Culbin Edge</a> was near perfect. If you&#039;re looking for a peaceful place with all modern life&#039;s conveniences then I can recommend it. We were really lucky and saw the Northern Lights and the Milky Way. Here&#039;s the view from the cabin (check out the website if you want to see the cabin itself):</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/aaffc-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201b7c8a03a95970b-120wi.jpg" style="display:inline;"><img alt="Culbin_edge_2016" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201b7c8a03a95970b img-responsive" src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/aaffc-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201b7c8a03a95970b-120wi.jpg" title="Culbin_edge_2016" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Science</strong></p>
<p>I&#039;m exactly a year into my three year project. It&#039;s really hard work, but it&#039;s going pretty well. I&#039;m moaned a lot previously about the downs of academic life in the last couple of posts. None of that really changes. Neither does the fact of me being really extremely lucky to be doing what I&#039;m doing. I don&#039;t know if this will be my last job in science, but if it is I feel like we might actually do some solid work this time around. Maybe I can write more about what it is I&#039;m doing another time if anyone is interested?</p>
<p><strong>And finally</strong></p>
<p>I&#039;m still using the sleep tracking, it mostly shows how badly I sleep! Nightmares, restlessness etc. I bought a <a href="https://www.pebble.com/" target="_blank">Pebble</a> to use with it, which has turned out to be really useful for other things. I never miss a phone call, text message or appointment (or can switch it to silent if I want to be left alone) or mislay my phone. I use it for timings too. I was so impressed I helped fund the next generation on Kickstarter so I&#039;ll be getting a new one that can also monitor fitness and can dictate text message responses. If you like modern technology as much as me, or have hearing difficulties, then I recommend them. Very handy for living the pseudoiterative.</p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[For most people the pseudoiterative is routine(!) And yes, every day is different within a routine, always.
What is the object out of focus on the horizon of the first camping picture?
Haven't seen you for a long time Al, good to read another blog from you :-)
Disappointed you're not joining Facebook but I will check out your Spotify listens if you'll send me the link. I'm always curious as to what you're listening to.
Maybe we can get it together over Xmas having failed to contact you again during the summer. Great to read that you've had several holidays.
Email me your Spotify link. (I don't do Spotify very often except to check out a CD (or vinyl!) before I buy it. That's if I remember after I've heard something I like.) Mostly buying very obscure stuff these days.
Looking forward to hearing from you and we must get something together soon!!

<p>As intimated last time, it was something of a death march, so I just feel a bit numb now that it's all over. Maybe with time I'll look back on it as an achievement, but at the moment I don't feel much about it.</p>
<p>More importantly, the contract for the proteomics project finally also got signed on the 1st of October - not this has prevented the ever efficient University HR department sending me a redundancy notice this week! But once that's sorted, I now have a contract for three years, and hopefully we'll do some interesting science. It's a nice change to be back in lab, learning new things, and being science immediately I've run into lots of problems we hadn't anticipated. But I guess that's the fun of it really. If one doesn't like problem solving, then it's not the right job. I'll try and put some photos together cos I think labs look quite fun and exciting if you're unfamiliar with them. And the techniques can seem quite magical (not necessarily in a good way).</p>
<p>Other things I've been up to are my data science learning, which I've really enjoyed, and this month I made my first web app. Again this might only be useful if you do a job which requires measuring things out and making up solutions, and apps exist that do this already, but it was fun to figure out how to create one. You can play with it here: <a title="" href="https://ab604.shinyapps.io/biochem_calculator" target="_blank">https://ab604.shinyapps.io/biochem_calculator </a>and if you want to play with the code, the repo is here: <a title="" href="https://github.com/ab604/biochem_calculator" target="_blank">https://github.com/ab604/biochem_calculator</a></p>
<p>As you may or may not know – I hate getting up! Especially now the clocks have gone back. So to make life easier I’ve investigated a couple of things. Here are my finding and suggestions for what it’s worth.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Health Warning:</span></strong> This may all be placebo!</p>
<p>That said, the idea is that we wake naturally from the ‘light sleep’ part of the sleep cycle – supposedly the dawn has light at blue frequencies that trigger a cascade of hormones and neurotransmitters that move us to the part of the cycle that wake us up. Consequently, if one wakes suddenly from a deep sleep or REM sleep we get ‘sleep inertia’ as our hormones readjust.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Dawn Simulator</strong> – I’ve used this in winter for about three years, and I think it helps. It gradually comes on over 30 minutes before my alarm goes off. I think the light should be more blue, but it seems to work to an extent. It’s gentle.</li>
<li><strong>Sleep Cycle App</strong> – this uses an accelerometer in your phone or wristband to assess which sleep phase you are in due the amount of movement you are making. You set an alarm time and it tries to waking you in a 30 minute window around that time by assessing when you are in light sleep.</li>
</ol>
<p>One a practical note, I’d say the dawn simulator is best, as it will always come on and alarm at the same time (which is important if you have to leave for work at a specific time), and the point of the light is to wake me gently rather than spot when I’m in the correct phase.</p>
<p>But the sleep app is really good for analysing your sleep, for naps and you can set it to tell you when you need to go to bed. The other advantage of the sleep app is that if you share a bed with someone who gets up at a different time, you’re less likely to wake them, as you can set a vibrating alarm.</p>
<p>We have this Dawn Simulator: <a href="http://www.lumie.com/collections/wake-up-lights/products/bodyclock-starter-30">Bodyclock</a></p>
<p>Sleep Apps:</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep.full.key&amp;hl=en_GB">Sleep as Android</a> £2.99 (14 day free trial, Android only. I use this one) &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sleepcycle.com/">Sleep Cylce</a> £0.99 (iOS and Android)</p>
<p>Finally, a few recommendations:</p>
<p>In the music world I finally signed up for Spotify and have been pleasantly surprised with how good it is. Both in terms of catalogue and in recommending me things I might like. On heaviest rotation since September has been <a href="http://www.jasonisbell.com/" target="_blank">Jason Isbell</a> Something more than free, but then I've long had a soft spot for country music.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Book-wise, I've absolutely loved <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/08/aurora-kim-stanley-robinson-review-science-fiction" target="_blank">Aurora by Kim Stanley Robinson</a>. All about interstellar space travel, what it means to be human and entropy. It introduced me to a fantastic, but sad poem called <a href="http://www.wordswithoutborders.org/article/the-city-the-spirit-and-the-letter-on-translating-cavafy" target="_blank">The City by C.P. Cavafy</a> (I like the Lawrence Durrell translation). I'm now reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Traitor-Seth-Dickinson/dp/1447281136/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1445542893&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+Traitor+Baru+Cormorant" target="_blank">The Traitor</a> which, so far, is also a fantastic book about the use of economic power and belief to control people, told through the eyes of one woman. Other recent reads are on the side bar, but those are my top reads of 2015 so far alongside <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Best-All-Possible-Worlds/dp/178087166X" target="_blank">The best of all possible worlds by Karen Lord</a>.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are few things I consider a sin, but self-pity is one of them. Which along with the general sense of ennui that I have makes me want to delete everything I write most days. However, Chris you gave me permission to moan, so here goes:</p>
<p>As an exercise for myself and something I thought my potentially be of interest to other people, I&#039;ve created a graphic of my life in science since 2008 (If it&#039;s hard to read, you can download it <a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/academic_timeline%20copy.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>). It&#039;s certainly not capturing all the nuances, such as the differences in scale and scope between my PhD project and Fellowship project, but hopefully it does provide some sense of my experience of life in the world of science and academia. Both the mundane reality that it&#039;s the minority of my time that&#039;s spent doing what probably most of us imagine scientists to be doing i.e. experiments, and the privilege that I get paid to learn and have a great deal of autonomy.</p>
<p>One thing I wanted to show, and I&#039;d expect this is true for many walks of life, is how scientists are always having to look ahead to when the money runs out, spending considerable time in the present securing funding for the future. I can see how this is good for preventing complacency, but it is a big distraction from the job in hand, and a regular source of anxiety.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/96556-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201b7c7bc8d2e970b-pi.png" style="display:inline;"><img alt="Academic_timeline" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201b7c7bc8d2e970b img-responsive" height="1356" src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/96556-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201b7c7bc8d2e970b-pi.png" title="Academic_timeline" width="1244" /></a></p>
<p>Drawing this time line also got me thinking about what science is, and why the hell me or anyone would do it. In terms of a definition I found myself in agreement with <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01100/full" target="_blank">this recent paper</a> that describes science as: <em>&quot;Specifically, it is an approach that strives to better approximate the state of nature by reducing errors in inferences.&quot;</em> Which to me is a more precise version of Feynmans: science is the best way we have of not fooling ourselves.</p>
<p>However, these definitions are very terse and needs unpacking, which is done excellently in a paper from 1996 called <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1949-8594.1996.tb10205.x/abstract" target="_blank">The Myths of Science</a>, but that&#039;s sadly behind a pay-wall. What it addresses is the notions that most of us have that there is a single method of doing science, that science follows a linear path from prediction to experiment and validation. The notion that science is about procedures (e.g. experiments) rather than creativity, the notion that scientists are any better than anyone else at being objective, the notion that all questions can be addressed by science, and that the process is honest.</p>
<p>I&#039;ll just pick up on two of these:</p>
<p>As someone who has an opinion on most things, I&#039;m acutely aware that these are just opinions, and would be horrified if someone considered them authoritative statements. And yet, I get the impression that many people think that scientists are somehow more objective and smarter than average! Including many scientists themselves. There are two good reasons to suppose this may well be false: One is that all humans have biases and prejudices of one sort or another, doing science doesn&#039;t make you immune to being an idiot (see <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/sir-tim-hunts-sexist-remarks-nice-guy-or-not-the-damage-has-been-done-10311617.html" target="_blank">Tim Hunt</a>). Second, is that each scientist only really has a narrow area of expertise, making them pretty much ignorant about everything else, just like everyone else. Beware any scientist holding forth on subjects they don&#039;t actively study, there&#039;s often no reason to suppose they know any more than you do.</p>
<p>The second myth is the linear path to scientific discovery. What I&#039;d pick up here, which is related to scientific objectivity, is the role of luck. This seems true in general, but success is often as much a matter of luck as judgement. And yet, as has been documented (<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mistakes-Were-Made-but-Not/dp/1780660359" target="_blank" title="">Tavris &amp; Aronson</a>) when things go well we congratulate ourselves on our amazing foresight and genius, but when they go badly it was just bad luck, or more likely, someone else&#039;s fault. Funny isn&#039;t it? I certainly think that it&#039;s possible to increase one&#039;s chances of things going well under specific circumstances, but so many things are beyond one&#039;s control that we can&#039;t ignore the importance of serendipity or even untangle what was luck and what was judgement much of the time. For example, I came to a scientific paper the other day by Google that seems to have a method that would be useful to me. I read it, tried the method out, got stuck, emailed the lab in Germany who&#039;d developed the method, got it working with their help, and now await some results. If it goes well is that luck or am I clever? Or a bit of both? Perhaps if I&#039;d kept looking I&#039;d have found something better? Perhaps if the guy had been on holiday when I emailed, I&#039;d have given up and tried something else? It&#039;s certainly not the linear: hypothesis, experiment, conclusions model everyone learns at school. More like: what&#039;s the next most obvious question? how the hell do I test it? Google the literature, pick something promising, give it a whirl, if that&#039;s no good, try something else. Repeat until I get an unambiguous answer or give up! Doing science is more a case of collecting and developing a set of tools, or a library of experiences to apply, and sometimes it&#039;s just a case of looking at things and making observations and connections, more akin to a creative process that a formal method of clear steps.&#160;</p>
<p>So I ask myself, why do I do science? Three things I enjoy in life: Physical activity and problem solving (you can take the ape out of Africa, but you can&#039;t take the ape out of me), and Visual/Written Media (exposure to ideas in the form of TV, films, Art and books). As with the other two, spending my time figuring things out keeps me from worrying about my impending doom, and I seem to have some adeptness at problem solving which itself is a form of positive feedback and coping mechanism. I figure we all gravitate towards things we have some intrinsic abilities in. And the more I do it, the more comfortable I am with having my ideas challenged and shown to be incorrect. I&#039;m not a masochist, but making mistakes and getting it wrong is a fundamental part of the process. And as I am someone who is easily fooled and doesn&#039;t consider ignorance bliss, if science is the best way we have of not fooling ourselves, then it&#039;s nice to have tools for being slightly less duped if possible.&#160;</p>
<p>The reality of doing science in my personal experience is that it is much more about failure than success. Sure you can see the number of rejections for our paper, but I&#039;m really talking about the fact that most ideas are wrong and therefore most of my work goes in the bin of bad ideas. This is a good thing! It hopefully means that what is left is what is worth keeping. Too much failure though and not enough success means that the funding will dry up and I&#039;ll be out of a job (true in most professions I imagine). I don&#039;t have ambitions beyond getting paid to find out interesting things, but I have to play the game and act like I care about &quot;a career&quot;. And I have never been in my comfort zone since I started doing science either, it&#039;s an ocean of uncertainty. So, if you asked me today what are the job requirements for being a scientist I&#039;d say 50% of it comprises of these four things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Resilience to failure.</li>
<li>At ease with uncertainty.</li>
<li>Good organisation.</li>
<li>Good communication.</li>
</ol>
<p>The other 50% is luck.</p>
<p>For myself, after nearly 8 years I can&#039;t really point to any scientific output of mine that make any real contribution to the sum total of human understanding, and that&#039;s a bit grinding, but I&#039;d be surprised if that&#039;s uncommon. I&#039;ve probably got until about the end of 2018 to make my mark before I&#039;ll struggle to get further funding. And I&#039;m not really sure how to gauge whether I&#039;m spending my life wisely or not. The road to hell is definitely paved with good intentions, so I know that intentions aren&#039;t necessarily what matters.</p>
<p>That said, I went to a conference a few weeks back and there was an inspiring <a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/Research/Faculty-Directory/Bios/Jennifer-Van-Eyk-PhD.aspx" target="_blank">Professor from the USA</a> who reminded me of the all the potential for making the world a better place that the area of science I work in has. She had a really nice way of posing the problem - our genes tell us about our ancestry, but our proteome also tell us about our present and our future. Our proteome are the proteins that our genes express that make us, us. (If genes are the recipe, proteins are the cake.) The important point here is that we are born with our genes, but much of what happens in terms of whether they are expressed i.e. make they protein encode is due to the environment e.g. what we eat, how much sun we get. Or it is to do with our age, whether we&#039;re a child, young adult or old adult. Hence our proteomes change over time and in response to the environment, telling us about who we are now and what the our future health might be. My proteome might mean for example, that at one time in my life a drug is effective, but not at another, due to the expression level of the protein that the drug targets changing with age. Understanding our proteomes would be really useful for many many things, and we&#039;re still only figuring out how to observe them, let alone understand them. The bit that made it extra inspiring was that she described some of the steps she and her lab was working on to take the science from the laboratory to the clinic, to actually make the knowledge useful. This is something that is rarely discussed in my current circles and always troubles me.</p>
<p>I&#039;m not sure I ever trust my own self-justifications for why I do what I do. Am I lost in the <a href="http://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/03/25/the-sunk-cost-fallacy/" target="_self">sunk costs fallacy</a>? Is it because I don&#039;t know what else to do, and it&#039;s inertia that stops me from changing? Or do I really think the potential future benefits win over the costs of dealing with the present obstacles? All I can say is that I don&#039;t think I&#039;d be too gutted if I had to stop tomorrow and do something else. I&#039;m sure there are other problem solving jobs in the world that I could do.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Something of a mixed salad to end the year:</p>
<p>Looking back at my <a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/2014/01/63.html" target="_blank" title="#63">#63</a> post from the start of 2014 I can see that still neither objective 1 (B44 paper) or objective 3 (H2-Db paper) have been completed. Objective 1 is about to enter its third year.</p>
<p>My job situation is still unresolved - each month my contract has been extended by a further month since my funding ran out in the spring, at the expense of my bosses. This situation can&#039;t continue indefinitely and either the legal people will resolve their issues or it will be abandoned. The project is a good one and it would be a shame for it to unravel. Since I have very little control in this situation, I just have to hang on for now (or choose to leave).</p>
<p>On the upside, I feel that in late November I reached an endpoint to the research question I started with my PhD in 2008. Unfortunately, as it&#039;s all unpublished, I can&#039;t write about it. I&#039;ve been experiencing this weird mix of satisfaction that comes with completion (after all this time) whilst totally frustrated that it remains unshared with the world. In the scheme of human knowledge and endeavour, it&#039;s tiny. A speck. But learning new and interesting things and then being able to share them is the WHOLE point. Not just a minor point, it is <em>the</em> point as far as I&#039;m concerned. Sharing knowledge, experiences and learning from each other is the mechanism by which we make things better. And it&#039;s driving me slightly mad that this is so difficult in the system within which I work. Hopefully I&#039;ll be able to publish it in 2015, but if anyone ever asks me what is the most important skill one needs to develop in order to work in academia, I&#039;d say it&#039;s the ability to tolerate/manage uncertainty. With a willingness to fail (in order to learn how to do better) as a close second.</p>
<p>Right, now that I&#039;ve got my moaning out of the way, I&#039;ll return to the subject of people with more significant problems and my foray into effective giving. I had a slightly deeper look into micro finance projects, and what work has been done to assess the effectiveness of charities. I should point out here that one may have many reasons for choosing a charity e.g. a personal connection, and one immediately runs into the question of criteria - what is an effective charity? For the purposes of what I was trying to understand, I wanted to know which charities save most lives per pound donated in aiming to eliminate poverty and increase equality. But the organisations that have looked into this sort of thing have more extensive criteria.</p>
<p>Part of what has always troubled me about working somewhere that is partly funded by charity is that we&#039;re scientists, yet is the charity itself evidence based? It sucks up a lot of public money, but is this the best use of that money? Are all these glossy advertising campaigns good value? I can&#039;t answer those questions, but what I have been able to learn about is the organisations which seek to assess the quality of giving in a similar way to the <a href="http://www.cochrane.org/" target="_blank">Cochrane Collaboration</a> does for health treatments.</p>
<p>Three related sites are: Oxford University&#039;s <a href="https://centreforeffectivealtruism.org/" target="_blank">Centre for effective altruism </a>and their related site <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/" target="_blank">Giving what we can</a> , and in the USA <a href="http://www.givewell.org/" target="_blank">Give Well</a>. I&#039;ll leave it to readers to investigate these if they are of interest to you, but it led me to understand that the evidence for the benefits of micro credits was lacking at present, so I&#039;ve decided not to pursue that avenue. I have recently donated a small sum to the <a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/schisto" target="_blank">Schistosomiasis Control Initiative</a> run by Imperial College London. My other small donations this year have been ad-hoc ones to the <a href="http://www.dec.org.uk" target="_blank">DEC</a> for their Syria, Ebola, Gaza and Philippines appeals. In total somewhere between 1 and 2% of my gross income (and before Gift Aid). Hopefully when my own financial/work situation is more resolved I&#039;ll come up with a more rational and proportional giving strategy based on the evidence (and my beliefs). I also keep saying I&#039;ll do some voluntary work, but that&#039;s another story...</p>
<p>Another thing I recently began is doing some on-line learning. I&#039;ve been a statistics/coding/reproducible science hobbyist for a while now and some nice people at John Hopkins University have created a set of courses just for people like me. It&#039;s free (although you can pay if you want to be certified) and they run most courses each month. I can highly recommend it so far. See here for the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=listingPage" target="_blank">Data Science</a> pathway I&#039;m doing and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank">Coursera</a> for all the courses (other sites are available).</p>
<p>In pizza news, I&#039;ve refined my recipe from <a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/2014/11/68.html" target="_blank">#68 </a>to use 200g 00 flour, 100g of white bread flour and 5g of salt. That&#039;s a third less salt, but still quite a lot. I&#039;ve also started making the dough 24 hours in advance. The results are not bad, better than shop bought pizza, but not as good as something done in a proper wood burning oven. They are still a bit doughy sometimes, which may be my bad technique rather than the method!</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/3c88d-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201b7c72640d8970b-120wi.jpg" style="display:inline;"><img alt="Pizza" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201b7c72640d8970b img-responsive" src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/3c88d-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201b7c72640d8970b-120wi.jpg" title="Pizza" /></a></p>
<p>Finally, it&#039;s not been a great year culturally - either that or I&#039;ve reached an age where I&#039;ve seen it before and so it doesn&#039;t have the impact of first contact - so I&#039;m struggling to think of anything I&#039;ve seen, read or listened to that amazed me. What I have discovered recently is <a href="https://www.hos.com/" target="_blank">Hearts of Space,</a> the ambient music station based in San Francisco. It&#039;s what you might expect - quite hippy - but I find it pretty good background for working or trying to get to sleep. You can try their on-line radio station for free, or get various subscriptions which you can stream to your phone, computer or whatever device you might have e.g. a Sonos system. If you need something relaxing to listen to at this time of year, then you might like to give it a go.</p>
<p>That&#039;s enough reflection for now. Time to do.</p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Been a little while since I read blog #69. I checked out the websites of the organisations that you suggested were worth checking. Particularly Give Well as they seem to be the barometer by which charities are measured.
Curious things these charities: in all cases, in Give Well's own reports, their results are often unverifiable! I'd have thought that the one thing you would do as a charity would be a) to shout about the good you do. And b) at the very least, have the figures to back that up.
Accusations about funds not reaching those they are intended for are more than rife since Band Aid first tried to do some good so I was very surprised that even Give Well's top charities are incredibly vague and inaccurate about their own figures. It seems there's nothing clear cut in the world of charity giving. Even with SCI, who win, for the 4th year running, GiveWell's top charity award, there are uncertainties about the efficacy of their methods. There are uncertainties about their results due to poor records or even missing results that are then made up to fill the gaps in their records. How did they win?! And  how did they keep, their top award? And just how bad are the rest?!!
I found myself doubting how wisely money was spent by one of the charities (I can't remember  which one it was now) as I read about their annual 'Colloquium' to be held in one of Vienna's most 'exclusive' buildings, situated centrally right next to the Stadtpark. The get-your-tickets-now call was followed by lots of seemingly air-headed enthusiasm for the must-be-seen-at event. Surely some people are getting off on this for the wrong reasons. Somebody must be paying for this 'exclusive' building and the insinuation is that it's not cheap. Surely the money could be better used.
Using GiveWell's site I thought I'd better check out the charities that I give to: MSF, WaterAid and Oxfam. As you know I don't agree with charity because I don't believe people should have to beg for what are essential needs. We pay our taxes and these should guarantee that nobody needs to beg. That should be a good enough argument for this country but there's also overseas aid. The rich nations continue to exploit the Southern Hemisphere and I don't see my taxes ending here: we should be supporting other people wherever needed and I'm glad to see Cameron has defended our Aid package to other countries and I hope that '1st world' countries will continue to help 'developing' nations but I want them to stop exploiting them too!
But I'm soft and, like you, I felt the need to make a contribution despite this. I chose those charities because they seem to transcend political boundaries and provide much needed help without prejudice: life saving medicine should importantly be non-partisan; water is a basic need that should be guaranteed by by all of us for each other in the world; and Oxfam just seem to be always there, wherever they're needed.
GiveWell don't include WaterAid as they don't meet GiveWell's strict criteria for recommendation. Oxfam are, in GiveWell's words, simply everywhere and too big and complicated to be comprehensively and meaningfully measured.
MSF don't make GiveWell's top charities either but GiveWell gave them the accolade of recommending them, in the case of the Haiti earthquake (as well as in one other case, which I've lost track of), as the charity to give donations to rather than any of the other disaster charities as there was no more that the disaster charities could do.
Thanks for coming back on this issue Al - I know your research is always impeccable! And very interesting, a well thought out approach; mine was ad hoc and relied on instinct rather than research.
Sorry I took so long to comment but I was doing my research (using your organisations, ta) on the train, on my phone and only when I had enough energy. (Lucky no charity is depending on me!)

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#039;s over ten years since I moved to Southampton and began writing this blog. I felt pretty old then and I feel ancient now. Back in December 2004, I estimated I had 2100 weeks to live so I must be down to 1580 weeks now. Have I used those last 520 weeks wisely? No, of course not! Does anyone? I&#039;m as clueless now as I was then...</p>
<p>Anyhow, I&#039;ve been putting off writing for about two months as I didn&#039;t want to just moan, but every time I sat down to write I find my thoughts dominated by negative thoughts and all the things that are getting on my nerves. Then today I realised I could just channel that and write about pizza...</p>
<p>One of the things I dislike about living in Southampton is the impossibility of getting (what I consider) good pizza. Pretty much every city I&#039;ve ever visited other than Southampton has at least one place where one can get a decent pizza. (And let&#039;s not discuss the state of Southampton&#039;s coffee...Actually, I will digress into the world of coffee and say, buy a <a href="http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/" target="_blank">Chemex</a> and never drink coffee anywhere other than home again. IMHO it makes as good as coffee as I&#039;ve had, providing you can get decent coffee to use with it. Of course, there are other reasons for drinking coffee out and about, but for quality, the coffee produced by a Chemex will do for me.)</p>
<p>Back to the pizza. So short of opening a pizza place of my own (currently under discussion), I&#039;ve been playing with Frying Pan Pizza the last couple of weeks. See <a href="http://myfoodeeblog.com/2014/10/02/cheap-fast-pizza/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://slice.seriouseats.com/archives/2011/06/the-pizza-lab-on-flour-foams-and-dough.html" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://eatingwithdavid.wordpress.com/2014/09/23/excellent-pizza/" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a href="http://pizzapilgrims.co.uk/frying-pan-pizza-recipe/" target="_blank">here </a>for where I took my initial ideas.</p>
<p>The results of my latest attempt are in the pictures below, but if you fancy trying it yourself here&#039;s the recipe I used this time, it makes two pizzas:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ingredients for the dough:</span></p>
<p>150g 00 flour (<a href="http://www.waitrose.com/shop/DisplayProductFlyout?productId=261004" target="_blank">for example</a>)</p>
<p>150g <a href="http://www.waitrose.com/shop/ProductView-10317-10001-2744-Waitrose+very+strong+Canadian+white+flour" target="_blank">Waitrose Strong Canadian White Bread Flour</a> (my preferred bread flour)</p>
<p>About 200g of cold water (doing things by weight is easiest for me!)</p>
<p>8g salt (more about this below)</p>
<p>4g Olive oil</p>
<p>2g of dried yeast (<a href="http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/shop/gb/ProductDisplay?langId=44&amp;storeId=10151&amp;catalogId=10122&amp;productId=17436" target="_blank">for example</a>)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ingredients for the ragu and topping:</span></p>
<p>230g tin of chopped tomatoes (<a href="http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/shop/gb/groceries/canned-tinned-packaged-tomatoes/sainsburys-chopped-tomatoes-230g" target="_blank">for example</a>)</p>
<p>1 teaspoon dried oregano</p>
<p>1 clove of garlic</p>
<p>150g Ball of&#160;mozzarella (<a href="http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/shop/gb/groceries/sainsburys-italian-mozzarella-150g" target="_blank">for example</a>)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Method:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Mix all the dough ingredients in a bowl, and then knead on the side for a few minutes, adding extra flour or water if the dough is too dry or wet, until you have smooth, but not too sticky dough.</li>
<li>Rest it for about 15 minutes (not sure if this is really necessary) and then divide it to two equal parts. I use the scales for that. At this point, the recommendation is to put the dough in the fridge for 24 hours. I&#039;ve not tried this part yet and just covered the dough balls up and let them sit on the side for an hour.</li>
<li>In the meantime, put the tomatoes in a colander and let some of the liquid drain off for 5 minutes. This seems like a waste, but does seem to stop you getting a soggy pizza.</li>
<li>Put the garlic, oregano and tomatoes in a blender and whiz it up until you have smooth ragu.</li>
<li>Drain the mozzarella, and use a kitchen towel to soak up any excess moisture, for the same reason as in 3. Then slice it as thinly as you can.</li>
<li>Next, you need a metal frying pan like this one and some oven gloves: <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/23921-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201bb07a8755c970d-120wi.jpg" style="display:inline;"><img alt="Frying_pan" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201bb07a8755c970d img-responsive" src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/23921-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201bb07a8755c970d-120wi.jpg" title="Frying_pan" /></a><br /><br /></li>
<li>Put your grill on the highest setting and adjust the rack so you can get the frying pan nice and close to the heat.</li>
<li>Now heat the pan on the hob as hot as you dare, and mind your smoke alarm.</li>
<li>Whilst the pan is heating up and the grill is heating up, roll a dough ball out on the side to the right size and shape for your pan. You&#039;ll probably need a bit of flour for this to stop it sticking to the side.</li>
<li>Put it in the hot pan - remember to put your oven gloves on.</li>
<li>It&#039;s important to shake the pan whilst it&#039;s starting to cook, else it will stick, like my first effort did. It should start to bubble up and you can peek underneath and depending on your preference either burn it or stop when it&#039;s going brown. A few minutes.</li>
<li>Turn off the hob and spoon over half the ragu, spread it thinly, leaving as much crust as you like. Then add the cheese.</li>
<li>Now pop it under the grill - remember the oven gloves or you will be sorry - and cook it until it&#039;s done to your satisfaction. A few minutes again.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#039;s it, and now you can either make the other one, or save the dough, ragu and cheese until the next day. Here&#039;s the two that I made last night:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/281e6-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201bb07a87644970d-120wi.jpg" style="display:inline;"><img alt="Pizza_1" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201bb07a87644970d img-responsive" src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/281e6-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201bb07a87644970d-120wi.jpg" title="Pizza_1" /></a> <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/6a79c-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201b7c7032f7b970b-120wi.jpg" style="display:inline;"><img alt="Pizza_2" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201b7c7032f7b970b img-responsive" src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/6a79c-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201b7c7032f7b970b-120wi.jpg" title="Pizza_2" /></a><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Comments:</span></p>
<p>So you can see on the left, the first one I went for a more burnt wood-fired style! It tasted better than the second one on the right, but unfortunately I stuck it to the pan as I forgot to keep shaking the pan when I first put it in, hence it&#039;s bit broken. The second one was more doughy, but still good. (I ate the doughy one last night, and the burnt one today).</p>
<p>My only really concern is that each pizza has 4g of salt in it (not including what&#039;s in the cheese) - which when you consider the daily recommended salt intake is 6g is a lot. I&#039;m going to try halving the salt and seeing if the flavour is still ok, and that the dough texture is right. I didn&#039;t take photos of the internal structure, but this recipe gave a bubbly structure that I liked where it was thin enough, but too doughy where I&#039;d left it thick. I may also try just using 00 flour and see if that gives a better texture.</p>
<p>The only other downside is that you can only do one pizza at a time, so if you are eating with someone or a group, it takes about 5-10 minutes between pizzas.</p>
<p>That said, it&#039;s by far the best pizza I&#039;ve had in Southampton - but the bar is very low. And as anyone who&#039;s eaten pizza with me knows, I essentially only consider a Margarita to be pizza! Occasionally I might dabble with the four cheeses, but really the purity of the cheese and tomato combination is what I consider proper pizza. (My blog, my rules.)</p>
<p>I&#039;ll be interested to know if anyone tries this and has any more suggestions. I&#039;ll shall try this again soon, having made the dough the day before.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Postscript</span></p>
<p>Following your comment Phil, I&#039;ve been looking more into the whole charity thing I wrote about <a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/2014/06/66.html" target="_blank">previously</a>, and it turns out that it&#039;s a bit unclear whether micro-finance schemes are effective, so I&#039;m thinking about charities/schemes for which the evidence of effectiveness is strongest. I&#039;ll write more about that next time, along with some of the usual maudlin introspection for which I use this blog... :-)</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As was kindly pointed out to me earlier this year - <a href="http://m.imdb.com/name/nm0000078/quotes" target="_blank">a man has got to have a code, a creed to live by</a>. :-)</p>
<p>And I&#039;ve been awake since 4 am again, so I figured I&#039;d write down my ruminations in a little self-help posting to myself.</p>
<p>I have a simple view of life as comprising of:</p>
<p>1. Problems that can be solved.</p>
<p>2. Problems that can&#039;t be solved, but have to be managed.</p>
<p>And finally:</p>
<p>3. Death. No more problems (Hurrah!).</p>
<p>To address point 1, the strategy I find that works best is to be well organised. Having a plan is pretty much the only way I know to get anything done. And a simple plan for me, starts with one of life&#039;s most fundamental questions:</p>
<p>What am I trying to achieve?</p>
<p>and must also address this question:</p>
<p>How will I know when I have achieved it?</p>
<p>There are many ways to do planning and be organised, whether it&#039;s analogue or electronic, and it is largely a matter of practice and review to get better at it. It&#039;s not an intrinsic ability, it&#039;s learnt.</p>
<p>I tend to fall back on the old SMART acronym (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Revisable, Time-based) as a sanity check of my plans and often apply my tried and tested, all-purpose algorithm in enacting them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take a small step in what I think is the correct direction, or if in doubt, any direction.</li>
<li>If the small step has made the situation worse, repeat step 1 in a different direction.</li>
<li>If the small step has made the situation better, take another step in that direction.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1 to 3 until I reach my destination.</li>
</ol>
<p>So that deals well with the solvable problems. Then there are the problems that can&#039;t be fixed and have to be managed. After much trial and error and general reading around the subject, my current strategy for managing those problems is based on the hypothesis that &quot;feelings follow actions&quot;.</p>
<p>This is the hypothesis which explains why punching a bag generally makes people feel more angry rather than calmer. Which seems obvious when you think about it, but it took me a long time to figure that out.</p>
<p>People obviously have a wide variety of temperaments, as characterised by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits" target="_blank">Big 5 personality traits</a>, but this perhaps is misleading as most people seem capable of experiencing the same wide dynamic range of emotions from misery to elation, whatever their baseline temperament. And if you accept that latter point, then combined with the&#160;&quot;feelings follow actions&quot; hypothesis, it gives me hope that I might be able to manage the problems that can&#039;t be solved.</p>
<p>For example, if I am furious about something that I cannot control at work and go for a run, or talk to someone else who distracts me with tales of their life, I will most likely through those actions feel a bit better. I have not solved the problem, but I have acted against my emotions and manipulated my feelings (in hopefully a positive way!)</p>
<p>One of the most difficult aspects of the &quot;feelings follow actions&quot; hypothesis is that the necessary actions are often the hardest ones to take, precisely because of ones feelings prior to acting against them, and there is almost a faith element required that acting will work. In running, we talk of stimulus control through practice - this is the process by which one learns to manage discomfort and performance anxiety etc. through routine and ritual, that has always struck me as analogous to religious practices. So when I read about the rising popularity of mindfulness it occurs to me that this an example of stimulus control following the &quot;feelings follow actions&quot; hypothesis. The point I&#039;m making here is again about practice and learning, as my belief is that people are more similar than they are different, so I don&#039;t really accept it when people claim they can&#039;t do something. They are confusing can&#039;t with don&#039;t. Which is not to say I think learning anything is easy. It&#039;s not - or at least it&#039;s not for me. But it is possible to learn new things, and get better at something through repeated effort.</p>
<p>The slight contradiction for me is that I also believe that problems have to be discussed and acknowledged if there is any hope of coming up with a plan and working towards solutions. The trickiest part for me is being able to distinguish between category 1 and 2 problems, and therefore knowing which route to take. In fact, I know these are false divisions and often problems are a mixture of solvable and unsolvable, and untangling that is also often part of the process. This point has come at the end, when in a sense it should be at the start. The implication of the tangled nature of problems is that it is important to invest in problem definition at the start of the process. Where I usually go wrong is that I set out to solve one problem and discover that the thing I&#039;m working on is not the actual problem that needs addressing (which is one reason for my little algorithm). The other trap I usually fall into (and another reason for my algorithm) is that of repeating a failed strategy and expecting it to work. Punching that bag and still feeling angry? I wonder why? Is that wall going to break? Or will it be my head?</p>
<p>Writing this is a thought ordering process, which while it hasn&#039;t helped me get anymore sleep, has demonstrated to me that it&#039;s all heuristics in the end. Right answers are for mathematicians and suckers. The rest of us are just muddling through, however neatly I can write my code, and so I finish by reminding myself of another favourite question of mine: How wrong can I be and still have a useful answer?</p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Steve. Yes, I heard him interviewed a while back. It raised a couple of questions in my mind: one was whether sports people are more prone to strange beliefs than the average person? I wondered this because of the unlikelihood of ever achieving success at the top of a sporting profession, and therefore the belief system required to keep trying against almost impossible odds. The second question it raised in my mind was whether sports people would benefit from his help more than the average person due to the work ethic that any professional sports person would have? I guess someone may have looked into those question already, and it does sound a bit like Behavioural Activation minus the jargon!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Jen. Glad you enjoyed it - a bit more of a ramble than usual that one. Looking at the date I wrote it, it was another 24 hours before I cracked the problem that was driving me crazy on this particular occasion. Which despite my neurotic outpouring, was actually a maths problem that I'd been trying to solve every day for a week, rather anything else, and all came down to a typo that I just couldn't see. It's hard to describe the sense of relief at having solved what was in fact quite a trivial problem after such a long period of frustration!
Bizarrely, I still woke up again at 4am for the next two nights. I'm putting that down to not being able to finish a paper we started writing back in 2012 due to my interpersonal working relationship difficulties. That's definitely a problem that has to be managed, rather than solved.
Ho-hum.
Anyhow, I'd be interested to hear what you are up to these days if you fancy dropping me a line.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/f6aac-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201a511d4f83f970c-120wi.jpg" style="display:inline;"><img alt="Hudson_June_2014" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201a511d4f83f970c img-responsive" src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/f6aac-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201a511d4f83f970c-120wi.jpg" title="Hudson_June_2014" /></a></p>
<p>Nearly July already and still no contract...but before I go there, here&#039;s an aside:</p>
<p>Being as I am I got myself a subscription to <a href="http://www.significancemagazine.org/view/index.html" target="_blank">Significance Magazine</a> this year, and the first edition I received was all about poverty and development. My favourite statistic was contained in this article that you can download as a pdf and read for free:&#160;<a href="http://www.significancemagazine.org/details/magazine/5871191/Is-aid-a-waste-of-money.html" target="_blank" title="Is aid a waste of money?">Is aid a waste of money?</a> It makes this point:</p>
<p><em>&quot;If you add up all the aid that all OECD</em><br /><em>countries have given since they started</em><br /><em>counting it in 1960, and then assume that</em><br /><em>the only thing that this aid has achieved</em><br /><em>was the eradication of smallpox, then the</em><br /><em>whole thing would still be a bargain, costing</em><br /><em>less than half what the UK National</em><br /><em>Health Service spends on average to save</em><br /><em>a life.&quot;</em></p>
<p>I think that&#039;s pretty striking, and along with a couple of other conversations about charity that I&#039;d had recently, it got me thinking I should probably give a bit more of my income away. And following the principle of public declaration making it more likely I will act, and on the off chance it encourages anyone else to do likewise, the decision I&#039;ve come to is to make a monthly donation and lend a further amount equal to my annual donation. A combined total of about 2% of my net income.</p>
<p>I looked into the charities that are allied to the <a href="http://www.dec.org.uk/" target="_blank">DEC</a> and I decided that I like the look of <a href="http://www.careinternational.org.uk/who-we-are" target="_blank">Care International</a> in what they do and that they offer both the choice of a monthly subscription and/or a <a href="http://www.lendwithcare.org/" target="_blank">Microfinance Scheme</a> in which you can directly loan someone money in a developing country.</p>
<p>Anyhow, there are plenty of other ways to give and charities to give to, both here and abroad, and I&#039;m obviously not going to make much of a dent in solving global inequality! But I&#039;m reasonably convinced that inequality is an important factor in most problems facing humanity, and what&#039;s that line Tesco&#039;s use?</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to hear Françoise Barré-Sinoussi speak last week (you can read her fascinating story <a href="http://mosaicscience.com/story/francoise-barre-sinoussi" target="_blank">here</a>) and to me she exemplified the scientist as citizen. By this I mean she was not only concerned with finding things out, but is equally concerned with the wider impact. In the context of her work, this means not only discovering HIV, but fighting for the rights of people living with HIV around the world, including getting access to medicines to help them manage the infection and eliminating stigma. Her talk was as much sociology as biology, and the other thing that I really liked was her use of &quot;we&quot; rather than &quot;me&quot; or &quot;I&quot;. The cult of the genius is a real problem for science, and while there are occasional geniuses, most of science is just like anything else, the result of the collective efforts of many ordinary people. I mean, she did strike me as fairly extraordinary, but at the same time she left me feeling that everyone could make a meaningful difference with just a little bit of effort, whether in science or any other walk of life. Which was pretty inspiring.</p>
<p>Telling my story backwards, I was lucky enough to be funded by my boss to be in the USA the week before that at the&#160;8<sup>th</sup> International Workshop on Antigen Processing and Presentation in Philadelphia. For those of you that don&#039;t speak jargon, that&#039;s my little niche of science. It was the first time I&#039;d been out of Europe since 2001, and my first international conference. To give you a sense of the size of the niche, there were 142 attendees, representing a good proportion of the overall global community. For me anyway it was a really interesting meeting. I felt like I learnt more about my field in 24 hours than I had in the last 2 years.&#160; And I got to put faces to many of the people who&#039;s work I&#039;d read, and made some new connections in my little world. I got to spend a few days in New York on the way, and there&#039;s a picture of the Hudson River round the corner from where I was staying at the top.</p>
<p>Before that I was at the Cheltenham Science Festival doing a bit of public engagement for <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/" target="_blank">Cancer Research UK</a>, who fund <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/science/research/who-and-what-we-fund/browse-by-location/southampton/university-of-southampton/tim-elliott-7056" target="_blank">our lab</a>. It was kinda fun, but exhausting.</p>
<p>And a week before that I went to Cambridge and gave my first external talk to the group I&#039;m a member of in the <a href="https://www.immunology.org/" target="_blank">British Society of Immunolgy</a>. In fact, I gave two talks. Just like buses, nothing for five years and then...</p>
<p>So, although actually doing the science is incredibly challenging, I&#039;ve had plenty of reasons to reflect that as I enter my tenth year in Southampton, I&#039;m leading a very privileged existence these days. There is a fair degree of cognitive dissonance, as pretty much everyone I know who works at the University seems to feel incredibly stressed, undervalued and demoralised. Even within my own team, I often find myself in the bizarre position of being Pollyanna. Which you may find hard to imagine! Certainly, I&#039;ve had plenty of moments since Christmas when I&#039;ve thought, &quot;I hope it all unravels and I&#039;m forced to do something else.&quot; It&#039;s a funny business I&#039;m in, and it can be hard to keep going.</p>
<p>To return to the beginning, I still don&#039;t have a contract and every few weeks since my Fellowship money ran out in April I have to ask my boss for some more. Currently, I have money until the end of August, by which time I&#039;d really hope I know one way or another if the new project is going ahead.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the struggle to get the science published that we completed in 2012 goes on...</p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Al!
2 things: I'm very surprised that you want to give away your income when you don't have a contract. I agree her talk sounds very inspiring but make sure you've got it before you give it. And second, I'm surprised that loans are a good idea. Loans have to be repaid. Surely that's compounding the problem. I give. I don't want my aid repaid.
On the other hand the acronym for the International  Worshop on Antigen Processing and Presentation is I-WAPP. Pretty good for something fighting cancer!! (That's 3 things. I know, I can't count, just as well I'm not a scientist.)

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks Phil. Well, I'm cautiously optimistic that I'll have a job soon, and even so I can afford to give a little. I've always been a bit wary of charity generally, on the basis that it facilitates us not doing things through governments and more accountable means. That said, I live in this world and not the one I wish I did, and this is one way to make a direct impact, albeit small. And actually, that's why I was struck by the statistic, government foreign aid, NGO's and charities really do add up to a large meaningful impact DESPITE all the problems associated with foreign aid.
As for micro-finance, yes there are problems with it too, Wikipedia has a good article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfinance . However, another downside of charity is that it is patronizing. Many people would like to help themselves if they had access to the resources to do so, such as a reasonable source of credit - one major criticism of micro-finance is that they lack a decent place to save money too. I'd hope that the scheme administered by Care International: http://www.careinternational.org.uk/what-we-do/microfinance goes some way to addressing the credit problem that arises because banks won't lend small amounts to high risk individuals. If the person who I lend to defaults, it is in effect charity, and if they pay me back, then I can re-loan the money to someone else. Creating safe and reliable sources of credit is itself addressing one source of inequality.

<p><a href="http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0089657" target="_blank">http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0089657</a></p>
<p>Above is the link to my first publication, a significant landmark for me. It&#039;s open access, so anyone can read it and download all the material, although it is really only of interest to a specialist audience.</p>
<p>It complements the work by my colleague Andy, which you can only access via subscription via the following link, but I&#039;m including it for completeness: <a href="http://www.jbc.org/content/288/45/32797.short" target="_blank">http://www.jbc.org/content/288/45/32797.short</a></p>
<p>To provide some context, if you do take a peek, this work is examining molecules of the Chicken immune system. This obviously sounds a bit odd when you consider I&#039;m part of a group predominantly funded by <a href="http://myprojects.cancerresearchuk.org/projects/southampton-research" target="_blank">Cancer Research UK</a> (you can see my boss Tim if you watch the video following the link, and my hands!).</p>
<p>However there a several reasons why we would choose to study this, some of which I go into in the paper.</p>
<p>Firstly, and not directly relevant to my work, there are good commercial reasons for researching the chicken immune system. I don&#039;t eat meat, but many people do, and I do eat eggs along with many other people, so protecting this important food source means understanding how to keep chickens healthy, and that means understanding their immune system. Secondly, and also not directly relevant to this work, chickens (and their close relatives) are a possible vector of human disease - you&#039;ve heard of bird flu, right?</p>
<p>More relevant to what I do is the fact that chickens diverged in evolutionary history from humans a long time ago. This has led to chickens having smaller, simpler much more compact group of genes that have the same function as a much larger, more complicated set of genes in mammals (including us.) When you are trying to untangle a problem as complicated as how cancers go unseen by the immune system, it&#039;s helpful to have a simpler system to work with. Any information we can glean from the simpler system may inform us about the the more complicated one.</p>
<p>Hence the usefulness of studying Chickens.</p>
<p>In Biology the simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology" target="_blank">Francis Crick dogma</a> is DNA makes RNA makes proteins which have function i.e. Genes are a code and their information is transcribed into another intermediate code, which is then translated into stuff, proteins. From proteins, bones, brains and muscles are made and information passed around, such as whether a cell has cancer. It&#039;s a lot more complicated than that, but that&#039;s the gist.</p>
<p>The complexity of Biology does mean that subtle differences can have big consequences, a good example is <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/101/motm.do?momID=41" target="_blank">sickle cell anaemia</a>. A mutation in the gene for the hemoglobin protein leads to swapping one &quot;residue&quot; in the protein, amounting to just a few atoms, and causes the hemoglobin proteins forming red blood cells to become stiff, such that they clog blood vessels or easily rupture leading to various health problems.</p>
<p>In my work I was trying to understand the functional effects of subtle differences in two versions of a protein which informs the immune system as to the health status of chicken cells.</p>
<p>The hypothesis under examination is that proteins are plastic like playdough - and that relative differences in plasticity between proteins are of functional relevance. The testable prediction arising from the findings in my paper is that I&#039;ve identified parts of the protein that could be mutated experimentally to see if we can alter plasticity and function in a directed fashion. (Back to you Andy).</p>
<p>I&#039;ve put a picture here showing how one of these proteins might move. This is a porcupine plot and the size and colour of the spikes represent the direction and magnitude of the motion of each atom illustrated.</p>
<p>Bringing this back to cancer (and other diseases), if protein plasticity is relevant for function in the same way in humans, then we might think about how to modulate protein plasticity. How? I&#039;m not sure we know, but we can learn from situations where drugs cause problems and examine if this is down to their binding to these proteins, modulating plasticity and thus function, in a negative fashion. This is something we might then reverse engineer to our advantage by designing molecules that would modulate the plasticity of these proteins and alter their function to make cancers more visible.</p>
<p>The proteins under examination are highly variable, so your particular proteins might have different plasticity to mine, for example. Hence a generalised and protein specific understanding of this process is the holy grail for exploring this possible route to using our own immune systems to manage cancer. And it might be a dead end. In fact I&#039;d say it&#039;s probably a dead end, as most ideas in Science are. But pessimistic as that sounds, it&#039;s actually how we make progress, by ruling things out, so that&#039;s what left is the solid, reliable stuff, and so that fancy new drug the doctor offers doesn&#039;t kill you when you take it.</p>
<p>To be ruled out, it needs to be tested, and for that it needs to be in the public domain, so that others can see it, test the ideas and report back whether they&#039;re worthwhile, need revising or simply abandoning. And that&#039;s why I&#039;m so glad it&#039;s published, cos it does no-one any good sitting on my hard drive unchallenged.</p>

<p>In the 2014 Meon Valley Plod I was 58th of 266 participant in a time of 3:26:37. It was a bit of surprise as I&#039;d got up that morning expecting conditions to be as bad, if not worse than <a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/2013/02/58.html" target="_blank">last year</a>. It was pretty chilly in the wind at the start, but as you can see in the photo of me going up the first big hill at mile 3, I&#039;d taken my hat and gloves off pretty early on.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/e430a-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201a3fcbd38a7970b-120wi.jpg" style="display:inline;"><img alt="12419961654_f184fd66bf_b" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201a3fcbd38a7970b img-responsive" src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/e430a-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201a3fcbd38a7970b-120wi.jpg" title="12419961654_f184fd66bf_b" /></a></p>
<p>And long before I got to Butser Hill at mile 17, I was actually hot and took my jacket off. The second photo of me is on the approach to summit of Buster and the other small photo is the view looking down from Butser over the landscape approaching it. As it shows, it was actually quite a nice day.</p>
<p>What was really confusing was the lack of mud, given the weather of the last few months. It obviously runs off the Downs and floods everywhere else. I did get caught out again at about mile 14 where what looked like a puddle turned out to be over my knee and freezing cold. There were a few more of those before Butser too.</p>
<p>I was about 15 minutes faster than last year, which I put down to the conditions as much as anything. I don&#039;t really remember a great deal of the run, it was one of those runs where I just got into a trance and ran and ran until mile 19 where I caught up with a guy called Rajiv from the Guildford and Godalming club with whom I chatted the last couple of miles. My favourite things about this year were that there were two fields of llamas (or alpacas, not sure which) and a greyhound that did the whole race too in 5 hours 12 minutes.</p>
<p>So not a terribly exciting race to report on this time around. But it is still a fairly challenging event, even in good conditions, if you like running. And at £16 entry, value for money.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#160; <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/41bdb-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201a3fcaeecad970b-120wi.jpg" style="display:inline;"><img alt="Mhc-3d" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201a3fcaeecad970b img-responsive" src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/41bdb-6a00d8348a3d9b69e201a3fcaeecad970b-120wi.jpg" title="Mhc-3d" /></a></p>
<p>I submitted my report for my MRC Fellowship today, which officially ended on January 14th, but because I&#039;d been frugal with my funds I had enough money leftover to extend my contract until April 22nd 2014.</p>
<p>Here&#039;s the compact version:</p>
<p>Aim 1: Continue development of research into MHC Class I antigen processing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Objective 1 is on-going (Publish B44 paper)</li>
<li>Objective 2 is complete (Publish BF2 paper)</li>
<li>Objective 3 is on-going (Publish H2-Db paper)</li>
</ul>
<p>Aim 2: Establish a new industrial and interdisciplinary collaboration:</p>
<ul>
<li>New industrial collaborators have agreed in principle to fund a new 3 year project with me as post-doctoral researcher, but the contracts remain to be agreed and signed. Next meeting to discuss this project in early February 2014.</li>
</ul>
<p>The three papers for Aim 1 and the new project I&#039;m still stuck in negotiations over for Aim 2 are those I referred to <a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/2013/11/62.html" target="_blank">last time</a>. On the whole it&#039;s good news, but it is a good thing I&#039;d kept some money back to pay myself some wages for a few extra months otherwise I&#039;d be out of a job at the moment.</p>
<p>The best thing that has happened is that I got my first publication (Objective 2) accepted yesterday by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLOS_ONE" target="_blank">PLoS One</a>. It&#039;ll be published in late February and as it&#039;s an open access journal, anyone who cares to have look, is welcome to. Not that it&#039;ll mean much to anyone without a specialist interest. There is a certain irony that this paper is something I started after I had submitted my PhD dissertation and the work actually contained in my thesis dissertation remains unpublished. But I did use many of the methods and protocols that I had developed in the previous four years.</p>
<p>As someone who is not a trained biologist or computer scientist and general sufferer of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome" target="_blank">Imposter Syndrome,</a> the following feedback from one of the anonymous reviewers was a particular relief, <em>&quot;This is a solid piece of work...&quot;<br /></em></p>
<p>It&#039;s a bit of a landmark moment for me, if somewhat bittersweet due to the massive friction created with one of my colleagues during the production of the work. The test now will be whether other researchers read and use my findings in their own work, and most importantly discover whether the findings can be replicated or refuted. But it&#039;s out there, even if it immediately disappears into obscurity. So I&#039;ll take the opportunity to be a big myself up and say that becoming a published scientist was not something I&#039;d ever imagined or aspired to when I was younger or when I quit TV, so however small an achievement it is in the scheme of things, it feels real, and that I&#039;ve actually made a small contribution to the sum total of human knowledge. Which is probably as close to immortality as I can expect!</p>
<p>I&#039;m still not sure academia is for me in the long term, for reasons I also detailed <a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/2013/11/62.html" target="_blank">last time</a>, but it&#039;s nice to have a bit of success.</p>
<p>At the top is a picture of a 3D printed model of one of the molecules that appears in the paper. I had it printed for the BSI Congress that I went to before Christmas and it turned out to be a real crowd pleaser - I&#039;ve since produced models for academics in Oxford and Cambridge who wanted their molecules printed too. I may have to change my profession again...</p>
<p>In other news, I read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/2312-Kim-Stanley-Robinson/dp/1841499978" target="_blank">2312 by Kim Stanley Robinson</a> over Christmas, and I&#039;ve since been forcing it on other people. It&#039;s a long book, without much plot, but it is probably my favourite read of the last 12 months. It&#039;s a book of enormous breadth: themes of love, the consequences of human behaviour on the environment, the scientist as citizen, the transcendent power of art, the consequences of longevity and prosperity on human form and behaviour, to name a few. But what I particularly like about his work is how human everyone is and how humanely he considers even the bad guys. That and the surprising nature of love reminded me of one of my favourite books, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dispossessed-Ursula-Guin/dp/1857988825" target="_blank">The Dispossessed by Ursula Le Guin</a>. 2312 is not a perfect book, some bits drag or seem a bit ridiculous, but if you need an uplifting read, give it a go.</p>
<p>And if you need an antidote for that, check out the <a href="http://www.richardkadrey.com/sandman.html" target="_blank">Sandman Slim series by Richard Kadrey</a>.</p>
<p>It&#039;s just over a week to year&#039;s Meon Valley Plod - Yes I&#039;m doing it again. It&#039;s going to be muddy. I&#039;ll post a race report after that, but here&#039;s the links to last years reports <a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/2013/02/58.html" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/2013/02/59.html" target="_blank">here</a> if you need reminding and wish to join me next time.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#039;ll be a bit closer to securing a job by then...</p>

<p>A bit of a diary update as I head towards the end of the year.</p>
<p>So there is the map and then there is the territory, the plan and what actually happens. These things have been very divergent.</p>
<p>The plan for life after submitting my PhD thesis dissertation back in December 2012 was pretty ambitious and as described last time in <a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/2013/07/61.html" target="_blank">#61</a>, much of the original plan has failed and had to be abandoned. As I mostly still self-identify as an engineer, I&#039;ve resorted to a combination of back-up plans and on-the-spot problem solving following the tried and tested methods that I&#039;ve learnt over the years to deal with the set-backs. It&#039;s a tough being Pollyanna when I can&#039;t seem to catch a break and feel trapped by circumstances beyond my control, and when there is such a high degree of uncertainty in my life, but the alternative is to just give up and I&#039;m not there yet. One counter-measure is to switch on the news and realise I&#039;m probably suffering from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring" target="_blank">the focusing illusion</a> much of the time.</p>
<p>The aims for 2013 were to publish three papers based on work from my PhD, two of which I would be the lead author on. This would facilitate another aim, securing funding to remain working in academia.</p>
<p>At the time of writing none of the three papers have been published. The most important one has now been rejected three times. The second one is out for review, but has caused a great deal of trouble along the way. The third one is yet to be finished and submitted. The knock-on effect was that I&#039;ve not been able to apply for any funding from a research council, as publications are a important part of their criteria for awarding funding.</p>
<p>Some of the difficulties arise from the age old problem of working in teams and teams where different members have different priorities and are driven by different incentives. Or to put it simply, those with permanent contracts and established positions aren&#039;t quite as concerned about losing their job as I am and therefore aren&#039;t in such a hurry to get the work done.</p>
<p>However, I&#039;m not one to sit around and watch the big boulder heading down the road to crush me, so I did think about worst case scenarios and my colleagues priorities back in January, and have been working with the things I can control to find a solution. This really amounts to keeping on trying, to being open to new opportunities and alternative outcomes, and to keeping on talking to different people. So much of life is about luck, good and bad, it&#039;s easy to delude myself that when things go well it&#039;s something I&#039;ve done just as much as when things go bad. However, if I can place enough bets and be smart enough to recognise a win when I see one, then hopefully success will arrive before I run out of time and money. I think the recognising it part (not fixing my expectations) and the willingness to engage with lots of different people that are the hardest bits for me. It&#039;s exhausting for one, and requires overcoming the great temptation to withdraw and adopt some fatalistic stance that amounts to just not bothering.</p>
<p>So although I&#039;m presently 7 weeks away from unemployment with no academic CV to speak of, I have one big bet still in play. That&#039;s the collaboration with industry that I initiated back in the summer arising from a chance conversation. This is work (mentioned in <a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/2013/07/61.html" target="_blank">#61</a>) is aimed at developing ways test whether a chemical is going to cause an allergic response without using animal testing. It&#039;s really nice because not only does it address both the problem of what causes allergies and reducing animal testing, but the information should also be useful for the kind of cancer research I&#039;ve been involved with. I should know if that&#039;s going to happen by Christmas and I&#039;m hopeful that if it goes ahead I&#039;ll find life in 2014 much more bearable. I recently spoke to a couple of other academics outside of my current circle and there are a couple of other opportunities with them I could also follow up on if this one doesn&#039;t come off.</p>
<p>That said, the last two years of academia has been such a death march that I&#039;ve made a decision that even if the new project goes ahead, if I&#039;m still feeling the way I do now by the summer of 2014, then it&#039;s time to do something else. I&#039;m not a masochist and as I&#039;ve said before, process is at least as important to me as the goals. This current process of dealing with a high degree of uncertainty in an environment where I don&#039;t feel supported to the degree I feel I should be, is not worth the effort. People don&#039;t do science for the money, so if it&#039;s not fun they go and do something that either is fun or pays well. Or at the very least, is less demoralising. Simple as.</p>
<p>The sad thing is, and I know this is not uncommon as other colleagues have said similar things to me, I don&#039;t feel proud of my PhD or the work we&#039;re attempting to publish. It&#039;s feels like something I survived as if it were a war or natural disaster. Which is not to trash the whole thing and say it wasn&#039;t worth doing and that this research is pointless, but it does often give me pause to reflect on whether the costs outweigh the benefits. Compared to other jobs I&#039;ve had, I have more day to day freedom than any other job and occasionally it does feel like it has purpose. But a lot of the time it feels like a game of egos and sleight of hand just to continue playing the game, and the whole aim of discovering knowledge has been lost to the goals of obtaining funding and prestige. We could and should have done more, and done it better in the time I had and with the resources that were available.</p>
<p>Putting all that to one side and in an attempt to develop my gratitude attitude, here&#039;s a short list of things I am thankful about from 2013:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#039;s been a great year for running. We&#039;ve done quite a few amazing runs on the South Downs in all four seasons and weather conditions, ranging from 8 miles to 24 miles. It&#039;s beautiful countryside at all times of year. The Meon Valley Plod was pretty special too. Nature put me in my place that day. And as long as it doesn&#039;t clash with my Uncle&#039;s 70th, I intend to do it again in 2014. We&#039;ve also run in Yorkshire, Manchester and Amsterdam. Plus a few Park Runs.<br /><br /></li>
<li>I managed to fit in more time off this year. Particular memories are walking the North coast of Cornwall to St. Ives in April. Gin and tonic and BBQs on the beach in Brighton throughout the summer. Midsummer in Harrogate. Cycling in the New Forest and on the Isle of Wight in August and September. Meeting friends and relatives in Manchester in February and October. (I like Manchester a lot, if it wasn&#039;t for their weather and being so far from the sea, I&#039;d like to live there.)<br /><br /></li>
<li>I&#039;ve read a load of great books. They&#039;re listed over in the side bar.<br /><br /></li>
<li>I went to see some live music for the first time in years. I&#039;d forgotten how magical that can be.<br /><br /></li>
<li>And cheesey though it is, it probably bears saying that I&#039;m grateful for all the support of my friends, colleagues and loved ones throughout the year. You know who you are. And whether I&#039;ve physically seen you every day, less often or not at all, it&#039;s all those small acts of kindness and words of support that keep me going.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#039;m off to Liverpool next week for my first proper academic conference, the meeting of the <a href="https://www.immunology.org/" target="_blank">British Society for Immunology</a>. Somehow it seems to have taken me 5 years to get around to attending one. I&#039;m a little&#160;trepidatious as I&#039;m not a great traveller, and it&#039;s not the most glamorous location, but it&#039;s a really good line up of scientists from my field and an opportunity to meet them and hear about their work (and tell them about mine). Another chance to roll the dice. If you happen to be in Liverpool, drop by and see my poster :-)</p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Al,
That's all some pretty heavy food for thought. A great shame that none of it worked out as I would have expected or, as your account states, it should have. Working in a university, as I am as a technician, I'd have said that although things move slowly they generally work out in the end to the benefit of all but things here are (slowly) changing for the worse and it's depressing to hear the same is happening to you. You seem to have been hard done by.
That you're thinking of changing is a great shame as university research is the perfect place for you. They need to treat you better and realise they should value you more rather than letting you go.
However, Elina is right, even the most ideal, altruistic employment is ruined when office politics and petty empire building get in the way (taking the place of the profit motive in business) and coping with overblown egos is as much of a problem as anywhere else.
Hope your aims work out and I hope you made some useful contacts in Liverpool.
You have a lot to offer Al, don't ever forget that.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/59bf7-6a00d8348a3d9b69e20191042ee21b970c-320wi.jpg" style="display:inline;"><img alt="Nidderdale" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e20191042ee21b970c" src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/59bf7-6a00d8348a3d9b69e20191042ee21b970c-320wi.jpg" title="Nidderdale" /></a><br /><br />I&#039;ve given up waiting for the right moment to post an update. I wanted to wait until certain things had been resolved, but things have continued in the messy fashion I described last time. I&#039;ve been reading about Zombies and I feel like I inhabit a world of (trivial) Zombie problems that every time I think I&#039;ve killed them off, they rise up again...</p>
<p>And I apologise if I&#039;ve neglected to answer anyone&#039;s emails in recent months. I&#039;ve not been keeping up with them very well.</p>
<p>So my main news is that I passed my viva in May and hence have more or less completed my PhD. I say more or less as I have some minor corrections to my thesis dissertation which I hope to have done by the end of this week and with luck, it&#039;ll get signed off and I can print it and I&#039;ll be truly finished being a student by the end of July.</p>
<p>To cut a long story long, I should have had my viva in March, but my examiner was ill and it got delayed until May. In the event it was a largely undramatic affair. More like a friendly interrogation for two hours and then I walked to the supermarket. No-one can say I don&#039;t know how to celebrate four and half years of hard work ;-)</p>
<p>I might attempt a post to explain my thesis more at some point, if anyone suffers from insomnia, but not tonight. See post <a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/2012/12/56.html" target="_blank">#56</a> for an overview.</p>
<p>The real outstanding issue is getting my work published. This is important for two reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li>One, I won&#039;t feel like I&#039;ve really done any science worth it&#039;s name until it has passed the scrutiny of external peer review. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Secondly, I&#039;m unable to apply for further funding from any research councils without having published my work and hence I could be unemployed in January 2014 when my current funding ends.</li>
</ul>
<p>It took five months to prepare our first submission and we were rejected from Nature within a week. No surprise there, but my boss wanted aim high. It was a similar story with Science last week. So I am now about to begin writing iteration three of the Zombie paper. A colleague from Cambridge took two years and 10 journal attempts to get published, and Emma in my lab is on journal 5 and 18 months in her attempt, so it&#039;s early days for me.</p>
<p>This has become slightly less worrying - in science the money often runs out before the success arrives - after one of those chance conversations that has led to an opportunity to meet with some people from industry in a few weeks who might fund me directly for three years. </p>
<p>As you may or may not know, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21740745" target="_blank">the EU have banned all animal testing on cosmetics</a> which means that anyone developing cosmetics needs to find ways to ensure they are safe to use that doesn&#039;t involve animals. The problem is how to prevent allergic reactions, and allergic reactions are due to our immune systems, and my current work is about another part of our immune system that parallels the part that can cause allergic responses to things like shower gels, and my methods don&#039;t involve animals.</p>
<p>So this becomes interesting to me for three reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li>One I might be able to obtain funding directly for three years without the pressure of having to publish first. I won&#039;t be particularly well paid, but a job is a job and they are getting harder to come by. And hopefully this is <a href="http://www.spring.org.uk/2013/06/the-psychology-of-motivation-explained-in-under-300-words.php" target="_blank">the right kind of job for me</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Two, it&#039;s the chance to apply the knowledge and modelling techniques I&#039;ve been part of developing to a different yet similar system to see if it works. I&#039;ll be able to continue working with my team, albeit on my own new project most of the time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Thirdly, it&#039;s a more tangible problem than &#039;this might be useful for cancer&#039;, that has been my PhD. It offers the possibility of yielding information relevant to many health problems beyond allergic responses shower gels and perfumes, such as reducing side effects in medicines as discussed in post <a href="http://independentvariable.typepad.com/independent_variable/2012/12/56.html" target="_blank">#56</a>. It also might help in the development of techniques to reduce animal use more generally.</li>
</ul>
<p>For industry, it&#039;s a relatively cheap way to investigate a possible avenue of innovation and the University retains the intellectual property rights, so whatever I might turn up remains in the public domain.</p>
<p>So I&#039;m mildly optimistic that it will work out, but won&#039;t be surprised if I end up posting how it all came to nothing in a few weeks time.</p>
<p>Plan B is to continue investigating the possibility of becoming a primary school teacher. </p>
<p>Fun fact: In 2009 the Times Educational Supplement stated that there are 17,000 primary schools with 193,000 teachers in England. In 2010 the Royal Society reported that only 5,989 (3%) had a background in science and 3,903 had a degree in Maths.</p>
<p>I&#039;m a breathing example of how a person can learn new things that aren&#039;t in their background, but surely can&#039;t be a good thing to have so few teachers with a background in science amongst the entire population? Hence it&#039;s a problem I could potentially contribute to resolving by becoming a teacher myself. I don&#039;t know enough about it to know whether I want to do it, but I&#039;m looking into it.</p>
<p>I&#039;ve managed three short holidays this year, as well as lots of walking on the South Downs. A weekend in Cornwall, a week in Yorkshire and a weekend in Amsterdam. All lovely places I&#039;d not been to before. I stuck a picture from our walk in Nidderdale in Yorkshire at the top.</p>
<p>I&#039;ve read a bunch of books in the past few months, which you can see in the side bar. All good fun, nothing too heavy if you like Zombies or Space Opera.The Rapture of the Nerds is a truly mind bending take on Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.</p>
<p>That&#039;ll do for now. Looking at what I wrote last time as compared with this time I&#039;m obviously feeling a bit calmer and a bit more certain. Or at least my sense of absurdity is better intact.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I wrote my weblog at Christmas it was with the sense and expectation that things were concluding and changing such that when I next wrote it would be to describe how things resolved themselves and my plans for what happens next. In the actuality, things have been messy, drawn out and often inconclusive thus far.</p>
<p>The year started with my new work contract and PhD thesis
submission and house sale all being problematic. These have been resolved and
replaced by viva examination delays, paper submission delays, interpersonal
communication issues with one of my colleagues, holiday cancellations and grant
writing delays.</p>
<p>So I guess this is a post about how that makes me feel and how I&#039;m dealing with it...</p>
<p>I&#039;ve just finished reading the second Dagmar Shaw novel by <a href="http://www.walterjonwilliams.net/" target="_self">Walter Jon Williams</a>. Early on in the book he describes,<em> &quot;a low twelve volt anxiety now hummed in Dagmar&#039;s nerves, sixteen cycles per second of uncertainty and unease.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Now, my life is thankfully not that dramatic and individually each problem in my life is quite trivial. But the idea of an oscillating sense of uncertainty and unease resonated with me as a description of my present experience of modern life and dealing with multiple small problems. For every thing that becomes certain another source of uncertainty manifests and often the certainties are themselves sources of anxiety. Relaxation is almost impossible and yet paradoxically absolutely crucial to successful problem solving.</p>
<p>I wrote last time about the importance of the illusion of control and focusing on process (rather than the target) as coping mechanisms for me. So it was nice to have my prejudices reinforced when I went to the <a href="http://www.brightonscience.com/2013/" target="_blank">Brighton Science Festival </a>a couple of weeks after I wrote that. I discovered from one of the talks I went to that what I call &#039;illusion of control&#039; is essentially what the psychologists call &#039;internal locus of control&#039;. The sense in which one internally feels that one can effect changes and control your destiny, rather than ones life being shaped by external forces beyond your control. Secondly, I learnt that indeed focusing on the process is considered a more effective strategy for visualisation i.e. if you want to get a degree, visualise studying and attending lectures <em>not</em> standing on a stage receiving a piece of paper at the end. (In fact the suggestion is that the latter is more likely to be detrimental to actually succeeding.) Attending to process is also part of being mindful as a coping mechanism, as the Buddhists would have it.</p>
<p>That said, as I&#039;ve also said before, I&#039;m someone who needs to have clearly defined goals and endpoints. Things that drag on indefinitely with no clear denouement are horrible for me.</p>
<p>And yet life in reality, as now, is often chaotic and without clarity (except for the obvious endpoint for everyone) :-)</p>
<p>In dealing with these feelings of unease and uncertainty, I guess that&#039;s why I make and refine my list of heuristics, to condense all the experiences and lessons learnt (and biases and prejudices) into a handy guide I can refer to for finding my way. </p>
<p>I confess I also I do a lot of self-talk. I&#039;m not even sure when the internal dialogue started, but it has a life of it&#039;s own now. Whenever I catch myself doing something I disapprove of e.g. being narcissistic or self-pitying or judgemental and bigoted or not letting things go or procrastinating; there is usually a internal discussion about my sense of perspective, my motivations and the relationship of my cognition to my emotions that frequently ends up with things being said out-loud. It&#039;s what I call &#039;having a word with myself&#039;. Usually it&#039;s positive, if a bit heated. I&#039;m not someone who believes in blame and punishments as useful strategies. But I&#039;ll end up doing it on a bus one day and it&#039;ll look like I&#039;m having a full psychotic episode. My current internal refrain is: <em>How do I get from here to there?</em></p>
<p>And obviously (as well as what I&#039;ve written in previous posts) another way I deal with it is to write it down. Writing helps me as a sorting process.<em></em> Even when it&#039;s inconclusive like this. It&#039;s another lesson I&#039;ve learnt: I don&#039;t always need a solution, sometimes I just need an outlet for what I&#039;m feeling and thinking.The solution will present itself eventually and even if it doesn&#039;t it may not matter. Maybe what I thought was the problem wasn&#039;t really the problem after all. What matters is dealing constructively with the emotions that might be an obstacle to getting from here to there<em>.</em></p>

(On another matter: Really enjoyed our evening together last Saturday.)

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a postscript to my previous post and in response to correspondence I&#039;ve received about running in general and specifically doing something as idiotic as running 21 miles in the freezing cold and wet:</p>
<p>Firstly I&#039;m someone who believes that the only meaning in life is that which we choose to ascribe it. So running appeals to my sense of the absurdity. I can honestly say while I was in some discomfort during the Meon Valley Plod and there was a short period of actual pain, I was never sad or miserable. In fact I was laughing and smiling quite a lot, precisely because it&#039;s something I&#039;d chosen to do and the absurd nature of running as an activity. It&#039;s a completely unnecessary thing to do in theses days of bicycles, cars and trains etc. Furthermore, running is a tangible connection to my physical self. I experience it directly, which is stark contrast to rest of my life which is an almost entirely intangible world of thoughts and ideas.</p>
<p>Secondly, running can be many things to me. On my own it&#039;s often meditative and my thoughts wander, order themselves and I relax and get perspective of my own tiny place in the Universe. Actions create feelings.I often used to visualise I was dropping my troubles like litter as I ran along.</p>
<p>Running with other people is a social thing and a chance to have a conversation without any intrusion. The phrase I read yesterday to describe the consequences of mobile communications devices - fatally connected. It&#039;s nice to be only connected to one or two people once in a while.</p>
<p>Or it can be with training with the club or a race or an event such the Meon Valley Plod and one gets the sense of well being that always comes from being part of an in-group.</p>
<p>Thirdly there is the illusion of control. We have so little control over the world we inhabit, yet for me anyway I need some veneer of control over the chaos to be able to cope. Putting one foot in front of another is very much something I can choose to do and create that necessary illusion. Even when everything else has gone to hell.</p>
<p>I don&#039;t think any of this is exclusive to running or that there is anything special about running. It&#039;s just what works for me. It could just as easily be making Art, part of having a family or something else. Different strokes and all that.</p>
<p>For me it&#039;s as much about the process as completion. I do relatively few events (or races if you prefer) compared to most of my club colleagues. There are occasions when I want to see how well I can do and I will take it seriously to train for that, but ultimately if I wasn&#039;t into the process of the training I wouldn&#039;t bother with the race. It&#039;s the same way I feel about Science or anything else, the journey is as important as the destination. I get equal satisfaction from completing something as I do from doing something well. Completion provides the quantitative sense of satisfaction and doing something well provides the qualitative reward. A bad run for me is one where I ran stressed and angry, which is fortunately rare.</p>
<p>I should also point out that I only went waist deep on one side. The bit where is was like a lake was mostly only knee deep, but it was impossible to tell looking at it where it was deep and where it was shallow. And the guy behind me did stop and check I was ok.</p>
<p>So I might do it again or I might not. I&#039;m easily bored and like to try new things.</p>

<a class="asset-img-link" href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/d22a0-6a00d8348a3d9b69e2017c36d9f8a0970b-320wi.png" style="display:inline;"><img alt="MVP" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e2017c36d9f8a0970b" src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/d22a0-6a00d8348a3d9b69e2017c36d9f8a0970b-320wi.png" title="MVP" /></a></p>
<p>In what was officially the worst
conditions since 1997 I ran my second Meon Valley Plod on
Sunday. The map here is the old route. I’ve not been able to find a copy of the
current one, but they’re pretty similar.
</p>
<p>I’d kitted myself out with three
base layers overlaid with a waterproof jacket with a hood on top. Leggings,
glove, hat and off-road shoes. As we huddled in the Scout Hut with the 300 or
so other runners, Kevin and Owen asked me if I was going to be too hot. I can
safely say that overheating wasn’t a problem.</p>
<p>The race starts and finishes on the
road, with a couple of miles of road during the course, but other than that
it’s entirely tracks and fields. Within five minutes of running we were in
ankle deep mud and that was just the start. Waterproof shoes were completely
redundant and it was as much effort pulling my feet out of the mud and water
and finding stable footing as going up and down the hills. My ankles, calves
and knees are stiff today.</p>
<p>As my core was warm I was coping
with the cold and wet ok for the first half of the race and I’d learnt from
last year by going off easy and eating something every 20 minutes. Who’d have
thought wet cake could taste so good? By the time we got near East Meon we were
running through the equivalent of a World War I trench, the mud was knee deep
and my biggest worry was getting skittled over by people going face down in the
mud all around me.</p>
<p>So we had two types of conditions to
deal with: Up on the ridge the rain was horizontal, stinging and the wind
biting cold, but it was a bit less muddy. In the woods there was no cold wind
and a bit less rain, but the deep puddles and ditches were full of mud and
freezing water. At one point it was like running down a waterfall.</p>
<p>But as I say, I was just about
coping with the cold, although I didn’t have much feeling in my feet. Until around
mile 14. I got to this bit in the woods where all I could see in front of me
was a lake of water stretching for about 300 metres where the path was supposed to be. The nearest person to me
was too far ahead to see how they had traversed the water, so I started wading
through the shin deep edge and got about 100 metres through. Then I took a step
and went waist deep into icy water. I didn’t really get warm again after that.</p>
<p>Between miles 17 and 18 coming off
Butser Hill I really was starting to be concerned I was getting hypothermic,
with my body shutting down and I felt like I was running on stumps. At which
point I walked half a mile and started to get some sensation back into my toes,
which was incredibly painful, but I found I could start running again. So I decided to make the most of it and charged for home taking about 4 or 5
other runners in the last two miles.</p>
<p>I think the look on everyone’s faces
when I arrived back at the Scout Hut after three and three quarter hours told
me how I must of looked and how they were all feeling. I sat there for quite a
long time before I had enough feeling and strength to move again, even to clean
my feet.</p>
I can confirm I was 69<sup>th</sup> out of 252 finishers of the 350
registered to run.
<p>My time was 3 hrs 39
min, nearly a whole hour behind the winner. The last runner was round in just under 6 hours.</p>
<p>When I got home I got in the shower
with my clothes on and the mud just flowed and flowed from my clothes. There
were even bits of straw in my socks from somewhere. Then I ate a cookie. That
always helps.</p>
<p>Biggest respect has to go to the
Marshalls though. I don’t know how they managed to stay out there in those
conditions and keep everyone safe, but I’m sure glad they did.</p>
<p>Here are some horrible
pictures of me – I’m even smiling on Butser Hill, though I’d lost a glove by
then. And I look misleadingly unmuddy. I’m already thinking about doing it
again next year after everyone’s nice emails</p>

<p>Some comments by other runners from the Race
Organiser’s Website:</p>
<p><em>“I have never seen so
many people drop out of a race, the conditions were horrendous. Well done
marshalls for braving the elements and making sure everyone stayed safe.
I&#160; have never quit a race before but at mile 11 (when I couldnt feel my
toes or hands) I just simply couldnt take any more. I am a seasoned cross
country marathon runner so I am used to this sort of terrain, but when I
started to shake I had to call it quits !! Well done to everyone that finished
they truly deserved their medals, this was my favourite race last year, this
years memories not so good.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I&#039;d echo everyone for
their thanks to the marshalls.&#160; It was hell out there, I was frozen but I
was running to keep warm so it must have been worse for the marshalls.&#160;
Every single one, of which there were many, were friendly, attentive and
helpful despite the conditions.&#160; A lasting memory of a forgetful
day!&#160; Thank you again.”</em></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I didn&#039;t set out to write a three part post about my end of PhD thoughts, but that&#039;s what I seem to have ended up doing.</p>
<p>At the risk of turning this into some kind of self-help manual, this final part is the result of conversations arising from the first two posts and similar ones I&#039;ve had many times over the years about generally coping in a hard and often arbitrary universe, where luck
plays a significant role in outcomes and it all ends badly for everyone! </p>
<p>Firstly here&#039;s a condensed version of my current evidence based philosophy for well-being that I&#039;ve learnt over the last twenty years or so. There are no guarantees of course, but this strategy seems to be most successful:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be kind.</li>
<li>Seek out enjoyable experiences - and importantly - when you find some, repeat them and keep on repeating them.</li>
<li>Mix with people that reinforce your sense of well-being.</li>
</ol>
<p>Secondly and following on from this here are my thoughts on how I&#039;ve learnt to cope with working in three disciplines in which
I am still essentially a novice and do not have time to become a fully
rounded expert. (Or as <a href="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/honest.png" target="_blank">XKCD</a> has the situation.)</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: actions cause feelings. (Props to Richard Wiseman for bringing to my attention the idea of the flow of cause and effect in that direction, rather than the other way around.)</p>
<p>Here&#039;s some examples of how I&#039;ve tested this hypothesis in my everyday life and I generally find I can&#039;t refute it:</p>
<p>Action: Looking at how much there is to know that I don’t know.
Feeling: Overwhelmed and anxious.</p>
<p>Action: Comparing myself to someone with much greater
experience or ability than me. Feeling: Stupid and inadequate.</p>
<p>Action: Asking for specific feedback, guidance and reassurance.
Feeling: Sense of normality, greater perspective and less anxious.
</p>
<p>Action: Making a plan along the lines of a SMART* goal based on
the actual time available to me and what is sufficient to complete the task,
rather than the amount of time that I would wish to have and aiming for
perfection. Making decisions about where to compromise breath for depth and vice
versa. <span style="font-size:8pt;">( *SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Reversible and Time-based.)</span></p>
<p>Feeling: Greater sense of control.</p>
<p>Action: Executing a sensible plan. Feeling: Satisfaction at having
achieved my goal.</p>
<p>Action: Doing something nice for myself or someone else, showing
gratitude to someone for their help etc. Feeling: The sense that most people are fundamentally
decent that counteracts the disproportionate effects from those that aren’t.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:8pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;">What can I say! Science is all about looking for underlying patterns and trying to extract over-arching rules. It&#039;s also all about testing the ideas that one comes up with from this process and generally speaking those ideas will turn out to be wrong or flawed. It&#039;s self-evident that if our ideas were mostly correct we&#039;d have cured cancer, sorted out global warning and stopped fighting over resources a long time ago.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:8pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;">So I&#039;m well aware that neat little acronyms and lists of rules are trite and limited in their ability to accurately guide anyone, but the question for me is how wrong do they have to be to stop being useful? Hence I decided to write this down anyway in the hope that while these thoughts may well be wrong and definitely provisional, </span></span>it may be of interest or use to someone. As someone said to me a few years back, ideas are literally useless if they are not shared.</p>

<a class="asset-img-link" href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/1b2da-6a00d8348a3d9b69e2017c347c072d970b-500wi.png" style="display:inline;"><img alt="MHC-Process2" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e2017c347c072d970b" src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/1b2da-6a00d8348a3d9b69e2017c347c072d970b-500wi.png" title="MHC-Process2" /></a><br /><br /><br />Having reflected on my last post and the comments I received I thought I&#039;d be a bit more positive and post a follow-on focused on what I <em>have</em> learnt and where it fits into the scheme of things.</p>
<p>Above is a cartoon I drew to give an overview of the process I&#039;ve been researching (click on it to enlarge it). This is the process by which our immune system understands whether most of our trillions of cells are healthy or not. Thousands of the yellow molecules in the cartoon are constantly travelling to the surfaces of our cells to act as billboards displaying information about the internal health of our cells. The information the molecule carries is shown here as the red circle.</p>
<p>Most of the time these billboards say all is well and everything carries on as usual. But if the message is that the cell is infected or cancerous, then our T-cells will instruct the unhealthy cell to die.</p>
<p>When we get a cold, this is exactly how we get rid of it. Conversely, the failure to identify unhealthy cells is one reason we die of cancer. And misidentification can cause an auto-immune response such as multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>In the cartoon this molecule looks like a solid yellow object, but actually these things are probably dynamic like us. They move and the bit holding the red circle may be more like a hand that opens and closes to select the information it displays to the immune system from a large selection of possible messages.</p>
<p>The focus of my research has been to investigate this hypothesis - Are these yellow molecules dynamic? And if so what does this mean for the information they select and any subsequent immune response?</p>
<p>To get a better idea of why this might be a useful thing to know I refer to a recent paper from Nature:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v486/n7404/full/nature11147.html?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20120628" target="_blank">IIlling PT, et al. (2012) Immune self-reactivity triggered by drug-modified HLA-peptide repertoire. Nature 486(7404):554-558.</a></p>
<p>(You won&#039;t be able to read in this full unless you subscribe to Nature)</p>
<p>This paper is all about HIV medication called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacavir" target="_blank">Abacavir</a>. Although this is an effective medication in the treatment of HIV, this drug sometimes has a side-effect called a hypersensitivity reaction. This is a form of auto-immune response of which Asthma or Rheumatoid arthritis are other examples and in the worst case a hypersensitivity reaction can lead to death from anaphylaxis such as can happen with a peanut allergy.</p>
<p>What the researchers in this paper show is that Abacavir molecule can bind to the yellow molecule in my cartoon in some people just below where the red circle sits. The consequence of this is to change the shape of the &quot;hand&quot; that picks the circle. It&#039;s proposed then that this changes the information selected, perhaps it picks the square instead. This changes the information displayed at the cell surface potentially leading to misidentification of a healthy cell as an unhealthy one and an auto-immune response.</p>
<p>This becomes interesting for me when I compare this to my research as I&#039;m looking at how the yellow molecule moves and therefore how the shape of the hand changes in respect to how it selects information. My expectation being that what they observe in Abacavir paper is a consequence of the Abacavir molecule utlimately effecting the motion of the yellow molecule.</p>
<p>So here we see an example of how a medication might cause a problem by doing something we don&#039;t want it to do. Abacavir is not designed to bind to the yellow molecule, it&#039;s supposed to interfere with HIV replication elsewhere. </p>
<p>But we could reverse that situation and think about how, for example, we might design and use a small molecule to deliberately bind to the yellow molecule and interfere with it to make it move in a way to select the infromation that makes a cancer cell more visible.</p>
<p>To be clear, we don&#039;t know how to do that and it could be a complete dead end! But we&#039;d need to understand how these yellow molecules move and the effects of their motions on selection of the information they present if we wanted to attempt such a thing.</p>
Hopefully this example gives some sense of the motivation behind what I&#039;ve been doing, what we call &#039;Basic Science&#039; and how it connects to real life. To make really effective cancer drugs (and tackle other diseases) we need to understand in a detailed way how things work at a molecular level if we&#039;re ever to move away from what one of my colleagues refers to as our current regieme of &#039;carve, poison and burn&#039;.&#160;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/5a9d9-6a00d8348a3d9b69e2017c34593acd970b-120wi.jpg" style="display:inline;"><img alt="PhD-Pics" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8348a3d9b69e2017c34593acd970b" src="https://oldab604.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/5a9d9-6a00d8348a3d9b69e2017c34593acd970b-120wi.jpg" title="PhD-Pics" /></a><br /><br />Just a short post before I finish being a student after eight years. Which is kind of an extraordinary thought.</p>
<p>I&#039;m under two weeks away from submitting my PhD thesis dissertation which I have been writing up since the beginning of October. I was told to allow 12 weeks and I really could do with at least 8 more, but it&#039;s a hard deadline and I have to meet it.</p>
<p>I won&#039;t have my defence until sometime in 2013, but it&#039;ll be a big relief to get the writing bit out of the way. The defence is otherwise known as the viva voce, which in the UK means I get examined by an external and an internal reviewer of my disseration.</p>
<p>I&#039;m afraid I didn&#039;t cure cancer and all in all it feels like a pretty mediocre piece of work. I won&#039;t really feel like I&#039;ve done some proper science until I get something published, which I hope will happen when I write it up for publication next year. With luck.</p>
<p>The good news is that I managed to win a successful grant application from the Medical Research Council and Microsoft Research to continue for another 12 months. Which in the current job climate is also a massive relief. The next step will be to try and apply for further grants to try and get some money for several years.</p>
<p>It&#039;s really hard to reflect on things with any perspective at the moment as I&#039;m pretty tired and although the stress is not acute - it is just science and one of the most priviledged lifestyles on the planet after all - it has been stress for a prolonged period. Pretty much 12 months of it. So I&#039;ll have to have a proper think about how to proceed and whether Academia is for me when the New Year comes. Hopefully my house will be sold too which has been another source of stress and then my mind should be a bit clearer.</p>
<p>I wanted to capture a few photos of what Science looks like from my point of view at this time. The above montage shows both my places of work in Southampton. The Life Sciences Building on the left and the Cancer Science Building on the right. Below is my bench and tools of the trade for my experiments. The rest of my work is computational, so there isn&#039;t much to photograph!</p>
<p>Anyhow, thanks to everyone who&#039;s provided much needed advice and moral support over the last eight years (and all the paid employment Jon!). It&#039;s been a rollercoaster, but hopefully I&#039;m a better person as a result of all this learning.</p>
